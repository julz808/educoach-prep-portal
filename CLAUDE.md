# CLAUDE.md - EduCourse Homepage Complete Rebuild

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Critical Project Scope
**LANDING PAGE ONLY - DO NOT TOUCH ANY OTHER PAGES**

This is a complete rebuild of the homepage/landing page ONLY. DO NOT modify, touch, or interfere with any other pages including the learning platform, portal, dashboard, or any existing functionality. Focus exclusively on creating a new standalone landing page.

### Preliminary Research Required
**BEFORE BUILDING**: First explore the existing EduCourse learning platform/app to understand how it actually works, what features exist, the user experience, question types, analytics capabilities, etc. Use these insights to improve the landing page copywriting and messaging - but ONLY if it's genuinely an improvement. The goal is to make the landing page copy more accurate and compelling based on the real platform capabilities.
