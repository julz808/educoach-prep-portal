## 📝 Example Quality Highlights

- **Reading:** 150+ word passages (not simple sentences)
- **Grammar:** Subject-verb agreement with plural subjects (not just singular)

### Proper Difficulty Progression

**Example (Integer Operations):**
- Easy: -2 + 5 (simple negative number arithmetic)
- Medium: Temperature change problems (multi-step with context)
- Hard: Bank overdraft with multiple transactions

**Example (Vocabulary):**
- Easy: "exhausted" with obvious running context
- Medium: "unprecedented" requiring moderate inference
