## Key Insights for Curriculum Development

### 1. Test Misnaming Issue
The test labeled "Reading Comprehension" is actually **70-80% Language Conventions** (grammar, punctuation, vocabulary) and only **20-30% actual comprehension** (passage-based questions).

**Recommendation:** Consider whether your curriculumData_v2.ts should:
- Create separate categories for "Language Conventions" vs. "Reading Comprehension"
- OR accurately label this as a hybrid "Reading & Language" section
- OR maintain "Reading Comprehension" but include extensive Language Conventions sub-skills

### 2. Actual Reading Comprehension Sub-Skills Present
When passages ARE included, they test:
- **Literal Comprehension:** Finding explicitly stated details
- **Inference:** Drawing conclusions not directly stated
- **Main Idea/Theme:** Identifying central message or moral
- **Author's Purpose:** Understanding why the text was written
- **Supporting Details:** Distinguishing relevant from irrelevant information
- **Vocabulary in Context:** Determining word meaning from passage

### 3. Language Conventions Sub-Skills (Dominant)
- **Grammar:** Subject-verb agreement, verb tense, pronoun usage, sentence structure
- **Punctuation:** Commas, periods, quotation marks, apostrophes, capital letters
- **Vocabulary:** Context clues, synonyms, word meanings
- **Sentence Manipulation:** Transformation while maintaining meaning

## Critical Recommendations

### 1. Reclassify or Relabel
Consider renaming to "Reading & Language Conventions" to accurately reflect content.

### 2. Separate Generation Engines
You may need TWO distinct question generators:
- **Language Conventions Generator:** Grammar, punctuation, vocabulary (70-80% of questions)
- **Reading Comprehension Generator:** Passage-based questions (20-30% of questions)

### 3. Passage Requirements
When generating passage-based questions:
- **Short passages (50-100 words):** 1 question per passage
- **Medium passages (150-250 words):** 2 questions per passage
- **Long passages (300-400 words):** 3-4 questions per passage

### 4. Difficulty Scaffolding
- **Level 1:** Simple errors, common vocabulary, straightforward passages
- **Level 2:** Multiple errors per sentence, advanced vocabulary, narrative complexity
- **Level 3:** Sophisticated constructions, academic vocabulary, analytical passages
