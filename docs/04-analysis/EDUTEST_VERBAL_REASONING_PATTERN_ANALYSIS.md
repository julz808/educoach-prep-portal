## Executive Summary

EduTest Verbal Reasoning follows **8 distinct question type patterns** with clear difficulty progression across year levels. Questions are text-only, highly structured, and test specific cognitive skills ranging from vocabulary knowledge to complex logical reasoning.

**Key Insight**: Difficulty is controlled through **vocabulary complexity** and **logical depth**, NOT question type variety.

---

## Question Type Taxonomy

### Type 1: Synonyms (Similar Words)
**Frequency**: ~15% of questions
**Format**: "Which of the following words is similar to [WORD]?"

**Examples by Difficulty**:
- **Year 7**: REPAIR → mend
- **Year 8**: CHANGE → alter
- **Year 9**: DOCUMENT → record

**Difficulty Indicators**:
- Year 7: Common, everyday vocabulary (repair, mend, broken)
- Year 8: More sophisticated but still accessible (change, alter, keep, new)
- Year 9: Academic/formal vocabulary (document, record, literature)

**Distractor Strategy**:
- Related words in wrong category (opposite, tangential)
- Words from same semantic field but not synonymous
- Completely unrelated words

**Explanation Style**: "Both '[word1]' and '[word2]' mean [definition]."

---

### Type 2: Antonyms (Opposite Words)
**Frequency**: ~10% of questions
**Format**: "Which of the following words is opposite in meaning to [WORD]?"

**Examples**:
- **Year 7**: INSUFFICIENT → adequate (not scarce, lacking, hopeless, subjective)

**Difficulty Indicators**:
- Word complexity (insufficient is harder than "big")
- Distractor sophistication (subjective is unrelated, scarce/lacking are synonyms)

**Distractor Strategy**:
- Synonyms of the target word (to catch students who misread "opposite")
- Unrelated words
- Near-antonyms that aren't exact opposites

**Explanation Style**: "'[Word1]' means '[meaning1]', therefore the opposite is '[word2]'."

---

### Type 3: Analogies (Relationship Matching)
**Frequency**: ~20% of questions
**Format**: "[A] is to [B] as [C] is to:"

**Examples by Difficulty**:
- **Year 8**: BLACK is to WHITE as DAY is to: → night (opposite relationship)
- **Year 9 Simple**: HOSPITAL is to DOCTOR as GARAGE is to: → mechanic (location-profession)
- **Year 9 Complex**: ACTIVIST is to RIOT as PIRATE is to: → mutiny (agent-action for control)

**Relationship Types**:
1. **Opposites**: BLACK/WHITE → DAY/NIGHT
2. **Function/Location**: HOSPITAL/DOCTOR → GARAGE/MECHANIC
3. **Agent/Action**: ACTIVIST/RIOT → PIRATE/MUTINY
4. **Part/Whole** (not seen but likely)
5. **Category/Member** (not seen but likely)

**Difficulty Indicators**:
- **Simple**: Obvious relationships (opposite, location-profession)
- **Medium**: Functional relationships requiring understanding of roles
- **Hard**: Abstract relationships requiring deeper reasoning (activist riots for control, pirate mutinies for control)

**Distractor Strategy**:
- Words associated with C but wrong relationship
- Correct relationship type but wrong specific answer
- "None of these" when applicable

**Explanation Style**: "A [A] can [B] in order to [purpose]; a [C] can [answer] in order to [same purpose]."

---

### Type 4: Foreign Language Decoding
**Frequency**: ~15% of questions
**Format**: Provide 2-3 sentences in made-up language with English translations, ask for meaning of one word

**Examples**:
**Year 7 Simple**:
```
BODO ET FUMY means CAN YOU COME TO MY HOUSE?
YAM EO FUMY BODO means YES I CAN COME TO THE HOUSE
SY EO FUMY means NO I CANNOT COME
Which word means HOUSE? → BODO
```

**Year 7 Medium**:
```
YUMO ONO WICKA means HAPPY HOLIDAYS MUM
WICKA WUIM FREK ONO means MUM IS HAPPY TODAY
POK WUIM FREK ONO means DAD IS HAPPY TODAY
Which word means HOLIDAYS? → YUMO
```

**Cognitive Skills Tested**:
- Pattern recognition
- Process of elimination
- Comparative analysis across sentences
- Systematic elimination of variables

**Difficulty Indicators**:
- **Easy**: 2-3 sentences, word appears in all sentences
- **Medium**: 3 sentences, word appears in 2 sentences
- **Hard**: 3+ sentences, word appears once or requires multi-step elimination

**Solution Strategy**: Process of elimination (identify words that appear across sentences)

**Explanation Style**: "Process of elimination."

---

### Type 5: Odd One Out (Classification)
**Frequency**: ~10% of questions
**Format**: "Four of the following words are alike in some way. What is the ODD word out?"

**Examples**:
**Year 7**:
```
authority, control, influence, power, incapable
ODD: incapable
Reason: All except incapable are attributes of high stature/importance
```

**Year 9**:
```
anxious, panicky, tense, agitated, serene
ODD: serene
Reason: Serene means calm; others mean opposite of calm
```

**Difficulty Indicators**:
- **Easy**: Obvious category (4 positive traits, 1 negative)
- **Medium**: Semantic categories (emotions, actions, attributes)
- **Hard**: Abstract categories requiring nuanced understanding

**Distractor Strategy**:
- The odd-one-out should be plausible at first glance
- Category should require understanding of word meanings, not just surface features

**Explanation Style**: "All words except [odd one] are [category]. [Odd one] is [different category]."

---

### Type 6: Anagrams (Letter Rearrangement)
**Frequency**: ~10% of questions
**Format**: "A single word of [N] letters can be made by re-sorting all the letters. Choose the correct word."

**Example**:
**Year 7**:
```
LISTENER →
Options: RILIENTS, ENLISTER, REINLIST, SILENER, TINSELER
Answer: ENLISTER
```

**Cognitive Skills Tested**:
- Letter pattern recognition
- Systematic checking of letter inventory
- Elimination of invalid options

**Difficulty Indicators**:
- **Easy**: Shorter words (6-7 letters), common words
- **Medium**: 8-letter words, less common words
- **Hard**: 9+ letters, rare words, or multiple valid anagrams with one correct

**Distractor Strategy**:
- Almost-anagrams (wrong letter count or missing/extra letters)
- Real words that seem plausible but wrong letters
- Non-words that look like they could be words

**Explanation Style**: "Process of elimination."

---

### Type 7: Logical Deduction (Select TWO Options)
**Frequency**: ~15% of questions
**Format**: "Please select TWO options which together most strongly suggest: [CONCLUSION]"

**Examples**:

**Year 7**:
```
Conclusion: THE CAKE IS READY TO COME OUT OF THE OVEN

1: The cake takes 15 minutes to cook
2: The clock is 15 minutes fast; it says 12:15pm
3: The cake is golden brown
4: At 11:45am mum said cake ready in 15 minutes
5: The cake is hot

Answer: 2 & 4
Reasoning: If clock is 15 min fast and says 12:15pm, real time is 12:00pm.
Cake was going to be ready at 12:00pm (11:45am + 15 min).
```

**Year 8**:
```
Conclusion: EBONY HAS A BROWN DOG

1: Jade, Ebony and Rhiannon each have a dog
2: Jade's dog is same colour as Ebony's dog
3: Ebony likes brown dogs best
4: Ebony's dog is not black or white
5: Jade and Rhiannon both have brown dogs

Answer: 2 & 5
Reasoning: If Jade's dog = Ebony's dog (statement 2), and Jade has brown dog (statement 5),
then Ebony has brown dog.
```

**Cognitive Skills Tested**:
- Logical inference
- Identifying sufficient vs necessary conditions
- Eliminating irrelevant information
- Combining information across statements

**Difficulty Indicators**:
- **Easy**: 2-step logical chain (A+B → C)
- **Medium**: 3-step chain or requires calculation
- **Hard**: Multiple possible combinations, requires identifying STRONGEST pair

**Distractor Strategy**:
- Statements that are suggestive but not sufficient (e.g., "Ebony likes brown dogs" - preference ≠ ownership)
- Statements that are true but irrelevant
- Near-correct pairs that miss one crucial element

**Explanation Style**: Detailed logical chain showing how the two statements combine to prove conclusion

---

### Type 8: Logical Sequencing/Ordering
**Frequency**: ~5% of questions
**Format**: Read a scenario with multiple constraints, determine order or position

**Example**:
**Year 9**:
```
Lily, Brenda, Simone and Claire descend a mountain.
- Lily arrives 2 places behind Claire
- Claire is just ahead of Simone
- Claire is 1 behind Brenda

Who arrived third? → Simone

Order: Brenda (1st), Claire (2nd), Simone (3rd), Lily (4th)
```

**Cognitive Skills Tested**:
- Constraint satisfaction
- Relative positioning logic
- Systematic reasoning
- Visualization of sequences

**Difficulty Indicators**:
- **Easy**: 3-4 entities, 2-3 constraints, unambiguous
- **Medium**: 4-5 entities, 3-4 constraints
- **Hard**: 5+ entities, 4+ constraints, potential ambiguity requiring careful reading

**Explanation Style**: "The order from first to last is: [complete ordering]."

---

## Difficulty Progression Across Year Levels

### Year 7 (Easy)
**Vocabulary**: Common, everyday words (repair, mend, broken, insufficient)
**Logical Depth**: 1-2 step reasoning
**Abstraction**: Concrete, tangible concepts
**Sentence Complexity**: Short, simple sentences

**Example Vocabulary**:
- REPAIR → mend
- INSUFFICIENT → adequate
- Odd one out: authority, control, influence, power vs. incapable (clear distinction)

### Year 8 (Medium)
**Vocabulary**: More sophisticated but accessible (change, alter, document)
**Logical Depth**: 2-3 step reasoning
**Abstraction**: Mix of concrete and abstract
**Sentence Complexity**: Moderate length, some complexity

**Example Vocabulary**:
- CHANGE → alter
- BLACK is to WHITE as DAY is to NIGHT (requires understanding opposite relationships)
- Logical deduction requires understanding "same as" relationships

### Year 9 (Hard)
**Vocabulary**: Academic, formal, nuanced (document/record, activist/riot, mutiny, serene)
**Logical Depth**: 3-4 step reasoning
**Abstraction**: Abstract concepts, requires deep understanding
**Sentence Complexity**: Longer, more complex scenarios

**Example Vocabulary**:
- DOCUMENT → record (vs. book, literature, words, documentary)
- ACTIVIST is to RIOT as PIRATE is to MUTINY (requires understanding functional relationships and purpose)
- Odd one out: serene vs. anxious/panicky/tense/agitated (nuanced emotional understanding)
- Multi-step sequencing with overlapping constraints

## Visual & Formatting Patterns

### Presentation Style
- **Clean, minimal design**: White background, simple typography
- **No images/visuals**: Pure text-based questions
- **Consistent structure**: Question → Options (A-E) → Result → Explanation
- **Navigation**: Question tracker on left side (Q1-Q20)

### Answer Options
- **Always 5 options**: A, B, C, D, E
- **"None of these"**: Sometimes appears as option E (especially in analogies, sequencing)
- **Option ordering**: Alphabetical when possible, logical when not

### Explanation Style
- **Length**: 1-2 sentences maximum
- **Tone**: Direct, factual, no elaboration
- **Common phrases**:
  - "Process of elimination"
  - "Both '[word1]' and '[word2]' mean [definition]"
  - "[Relationship explanation showing parallel structure]"
  - "The order from first to last is..."

---

## Key Distractor Patterns

### Synonyms
- **Antonyms** of target word (catch students who confuse similar/opposite)
- **Related but not synonymous** (e.g., "broken" is related to "repair" but not a synonym)
- **Words from same domain** but wrong relationship

### Antonyms
- **Synonyms** of target word (catch misreading)
- **Unrelated words** with similar sound/spelling
- **Near-antonyms** that aren't exact opposites

### Analogies
- **Associated words** (e.g., PIRATE → ocean/sail, but wrong relationship)
- **Same category, wrong relationship** (e.g., pirate terrorizes, not mutinies)
- **"None of these"** when all options are wrong

### Foreign Language
- **Words that appear frequently** but mean something else
- **Process of elimination** is the key

### Odd One Out
- **Plausible categories** (e.g., "hopeless" could seem negative like "insufficient")
- **Surface similarity** (all start with same letter, all same length)

### Logical Deduction
- **Sufficient but not necessary** (e.g., "Ebony likes brown dogs" suggests preference but doesn't prove ownership)
- **True but irrelevant** (doesn't contribute to conclusion)
- **Individually strong but not STRONGEST pair**

## Question Generation Insights

### What Makes a Good EduTest Verbal Reasoning Question?

1. **Unambiguous correct answer**: Only ONE option can be definitively correct
2. **Plausible distractors**: Wrong answers should seem reasonable at first glance
3. **Clear explanation**: Can be explained in 1-2 sentences using logical reasoning
4. **Appropriate difficulty**: Vocabulary and logic match target year level
5. **No cultural bias**: Avoid region-specific knowledge
6. **No visual dependence**: Pure text-based

### Common Quality Issues to Avoid

1. **Multiple correct answers**: Synonyms that are too close
2. **Arbitrary distractors**: Random words with no plausibility
3. **Cultural/regional bias**: Using local idioms or references
4. **Ambiguous wording**: "Which word BEST matches" vs. "Which word is similar"
5. **Over-complicated explanations**: Should be simple and direct

## Recommended Generation Strategy

### For Claude LLM API Generation:

1. **Define clear question type schemas** (8 types above)
2. **Provide year-level vocabulary lists**:
   - Year 7: 500 common words + basic synonyms/antonyms
   - Year 8: 800 intermediate words + nuanced meanings
   - Year 9: 1000+ academic/formal words + abstract concepts

3. **Use few-shot prompting** with 2-3 examples per question type
4. **Validate distractors independently**: Ask Claude to verify each distractor is definitively wrong
5. **Check explanation clarity**: Must be explainable in 1-2 sentences
6. **Difficulty calibration**: Provide vocabulary complexity guidelines per year level
