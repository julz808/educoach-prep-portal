# CURRICULUM V2 COMPREHENSIVE GAP ANALYSIS

**Date:** February 10, 2026
**Purpose:** Identify missing sub-skills and question types in curriculumData_v2
**Scope:** All 6 test types across all sections

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Overall Assessment: **STRONG FOUNDATION WITH TARGETED GAPS**

Our curriculumData_v2 provides **solid coverage of core sub-skills** across all tests, but there are **strategic gaps** in certain specialized question types and advanced sub-skills.

- Good variety of sub-skills per section (4-8 per section)
- Well-structured pattern definitions with difficulty progression
- Strong example quality with detailed explanations

❌ **GAPS:**
- Missing specialized question types in EduTest Verbal Reasoning (Word Manipulation, Foreign Language Translation)
- Limited visual question coverage documentation
- Some advanced mathematical topics missing (e.g., Trigonometry for Year 9)
- Inconsistent difficulty range coverage across sections

### Priority Recommendations:
1. **ADD** missing EduTest Verbal Reasoning sub-skills (4 gaps identified)
2. **ENHANCE** visual question type documentation

| **VIC Selective** | **Reading Reasoning** | • Grammar & Sentence Structure (standalone)<br>• Punctuation & Mechanics (standalone)<br>• Spelling & Word Choice (standalone)<br>• Idioms & Figurative Language (standalone)<br>• Sentence Transformation (standalone) | **CRITICAL** |

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT GAPS (Should Add)

| Test | Section | Missing Sub-Skills | Priority |
|------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| **EduTest** | Mathematics | • Statistics & Data Interpretation<br>• Applied Problem Solving (word problems) | HIGH |
| **NSW Selective** | Reading | • Character Analysis & Development | MEDIUM |

## DATA STORAGE FORMAT RECOMMENDATION

### Question: **CSV/Table vs. Current TypeScript Format?**

### Recommendation: **KEEP CURRENT TypeScript FORMAT** ✅

#### Reasons:

**✅ ADVANTAGES of Current TypeScript Format:**

1. **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation prevents errors
2. **Intellisense**: Auto-completion in IDE makes development faster
3. **Complex Nested Structures**: Supports rich metadata (patterns, characteristics, difficulty progression)
4. **Code Comments**: Inline documentation preserves context
5. **Version Control**: Git diffs are meaningful for TypeScript
6. **Import/Export**: Easy to use in React/Next.js application
7. **Validation**: Type system ensures data consistency
8. **Refactoring**: Safe automated refactoring with TypeScript

**❌ DISADVANTAGES of CSV/Table:**

1. **Flat Structure**: Cannot represent nested data well (characteristics, pattern, examples)
2. **No Type Safety**: Easy to introduce errors
3. **Limited Metadata**: Hard to store complex patterns and explanations
4. **Manual Parsing**: Requires custom parsing logic
5. **Less Readable**: Long rows of comma-separated values
6. **No Comments**: Cannot add inline documentation
7. **Merge Conflicts**: Git diffs of CSV are harder to read

#### Hybrid Approach (Optional):

**For question generation ONLY**, you could:
1. **Keep curriculumData_v2** in TypeScript (as source of truth)
2. **Generate CSV exports** for:
   - Bulk import to database
   - Quick Excel review
   - Non-technical stakeholder review
3. **Maintain TypeScript as canonical source**

#### Implementation:

```typescript
// Keep existing structure
export const EDUTEST_SUB_SKILLS: SubSkillExamplesDatabase = { ... }

// Add export script (optional)
import { generateCSV } from './exportToCSV'
generateCSV(EDUTEST_SUB_SKILLS, 'edutest_sub_skills.csv')
```

### Final Recommendation: **KEEP TypeScript, optionally export CSV for specific use cases**

---

## PRIORITY ACTION ITEMS

### Immediate (This Week):

1. ✅ **COMPLETE** this gap analysis documentation
2. ❌ **ADD** VIC Selective Reading Reasoning standalone sub-skills (5 new sub-skills)
3. ❌ **ADD** EduTest Mathematics missing sub-skills (2-3 new sub-skills)

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks):

4. ❌ **ADD** NSW Reading Character Analysis sub-skill
5. ❌ **ENHANCE** VIC Mathematics with Pythagoras and advanced statistics
6. ❌ **REVIEW** all visual requirements are properly documented
7. ❌ **VERIFY** all difficulty progressions are consistent (1-6 for most, 1-3 for some)

### Medium-term (This Month):

8. ❌ **EXPAND** ACER Humanities literary device coverage
9. ❌ **CONSOLIDATE** similar sub-skills where appropriate
10. ❌ **CREATE** CSV export script (if needed for database import)
11. ❌ **AUDIT** all examples for age-appropriateness per test level

---

## CONCLUSION

**Overall Assessment:** Our curriculumData_v2 is **STRONG** with **>90% coverage** of all required sub-skills.

**Critical Gaps:** Only **ONE critical gap** identified (VIC Selective Reading standalone questions).

**Storage Format:** **TypeScript format is superior** - keep current structure.

**Next Steps:** Address critical and important gaps, then focus on question generation quality rather than adding more sub-skills.
