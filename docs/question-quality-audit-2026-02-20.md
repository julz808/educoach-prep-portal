Passage: The Mystery of the Moai: How Ancient Islanders Moved Giant Statues

On a remote island in the Pacific Ocean, hundreds of enormous stone statues stand guard along the coastline. These mysterious figures, called moai, have puzzled scientists and visitors for centuries. The moai are found on Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui, which lies over 3,500 kilometres from the nearest continent. The island's ancient inhabitants carved these impressive statues between 1400 and 1650 CE, but the question remains: how did they move them?

The moai are truly remarkable in size and number. Nearly 900 statues exist on the island, with the average moai standing about four metres tall and weighing around 14 tonnes. The largest moai ever erected reached an incredible ten metres in height. The statues were carved from volcanic rock found in a quarry on one side of the island. Workers used simple stone tools called toki to chip away at the rock face. Once a statue was finished, it had to be transported to its final location, sometimes more than ten kilometres away.

For many years, people believed the islanders used wooden logs as rollers to move the massive statues. They thought teams of workers pushed or pulled the moai across these rolling logs. However, recent research suggests a different method. Scientists now think the islanders 'walked' the statues to their destinations. This technique involved rocking the moai from side to side whilst pulling it forward with ropes. The statues have a special shape with a forward-leaning design that makes this walking motion possible.

In 2012, researchers tested this walking theory with a concrete replica of a moai. A team of eighteen people used three ropes to move the three-metre-tall statue. They pulled the ropes in a coordinated pattern, causing the statue to waddle forward like a penguin. The experiment proved successful, and the replica travelled about 100 metres. This discovery changed our understanding of how the ancient Rapa Nui people accomplished this engineering feat.

The moai represent more than just impressive stone carvings. Each statue honoured an important ancestor or chief of the island's clans. The islanders believed the moai held spiritual power and protected their communities. Families competed to create the largest and most impressive statues, which explains why so many were made. Sadly, by the 1800s, all the moai had been toppled during conflicts between clans. Today, many have been restored and stand once again, reminding us of the ingenuity and determination of the Rapa Nui people. Their achievement demonstrates that ancient societies developed clever solutions to difficult problems using simple tools, teamwork, and creative thinking.

The moai statues were carved from:
A) marble
B) volcanic rock
C) limestone
D) granite

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) marble
2. [ ] B) volcanic rock
3. [ ] C) limestone
4. [ ] D) granite

**Solution:**
> • The passage states in the second paragraph: 'The statues were carved from volcanic rock found in a quarry on one side of the island.'
• This directly identifies the material used to create the moai statues.
• Therefore, the answer is B because the passage explicitly states the statues were carved from volcanic rock.

Passage: Screen-Free Lunch Breaks: Why Schools Must Ban Phones at Recess

Walk into any school playground today and you will see something deeply troubling. Instead of children running, laughing and playing together, you will find groups of students hunched over their phones, isolated in their own digital worlds. This is not the childhood we should be giving our young people. Schools must ban mobile phones during lunch breaks and recess to protect student wellbeing.

The evidence is clear and alarming. A recent study of 2,000 Australian secondary students found that those who spent their breaks on phones reported feeling lonelier than those who played actively. How can this be? They are connected to hundreds of friends online, yet they feel more isolated than ever. The answer is simple: scrolling through social media is not real connection. Real friendship happens face to face, through shared games, conversations and experiences.

Physical health is another victim of phone-dominated breaks. The Australian Health Department recommends that teenagers get at least 60 minutes of physical activity daily. School breaks provide a perfect opportunity for this exercise. Yet when students spend their precious free time staring at screens, they miss this chance entirely. Childhood obesity rates have doubled in the past twenty years. Can we really afford to waste these vital opportunities for movement?

Some argue that phones help students relax during their busy school day. This argument falls apart under examination. Research from the University of Melbourne shows that recreational screen time actually increases stress and anxiety in young people. Students return to class more distracted, not more refreshed. What truly helps children relax? Playing sport, chatting with friends, or simply enjoying fresh air and sunshine.

Critics also claim that banning phones violates student freedom. But freedom without responsibility is meaningless. Schools already restrict many things to protect students: we do not allow them to skip class, eat only lollies, or leave the grounds whenever they wish. We make these rules because we understand that young people need guidance. Phone bans during breaks are no different.

Several schools have already taken this brave step, and the results speak for themselves. At Greendale Secondary College in Victoria, playground phone bans led to a 40% reduction in bullying incidents and a noticeable increase in active play. Teachers reported happier, more engaged students. Parents noticed children coming home with stories about real games and real friendships.

Our children deserve better than a childhood spent staring at screens. They deserve the joy of kicking a football, the thrill of playground games, and the warmth of genuine human connection. Schools have a responsibility to create environments where young people can thrive. Banning phones during breaks is not about being old-fashioned or controlling. It is about giving students back what they are losing: their childhood.

What can be inferred about the author's view of online friendships?
A) They are more convenient than face-to-face friendships
B) They cannot replace the value of in-person connections
C) They help reduce feelings of loneliness in students
D) They are the main cause of childhood obesity

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) They are more convenient than face-to-face friendships
2. [ ] B) They cannot replace the value of in-person connections
3. [ ] C) They help reduce feelings of loneliness in students
4. [ ] D) They are the main cause of childhood obesity

**Solution:**
> • The author states that students connected to hundreds of friends online still feel more isolated than ever
• The author explicitly says 'scrolling through social media is not real connection' and that 'real friendship happens face to face'
• The author contrasts online connections with genuine human connection throughout the passage
• Therefore, the answer is B because the author clearly believes online friendships cannot replace the value of in-person connections

We make these rules because we understand that young people need guidance. Phone bans during breaks are no different.

Several schools have already taken this brave step, and the results speak for themselves. At Greendale Secondary College in Victoria, playground phone bans led to a 40% reduction in bullying incidents and a noticeable increase in active play. Teachers reported happier, more engaged students. Parents noticed children coming home with stories about real games and real friendships.

Our children deserve better than a childhood spent staring at screens. They deserve the joy of kicking a football, the thrill of playground games, and the warmth of genuine human connection. Schools have a responsibility to create environments where young people can thrive. Banning phones during breaks is not about being old-fashioned or controlling. It is about giving students back what they are losing: their childhood.

What can we infer about the author's view of schools that have not yet banned phones during breaks?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) They are prioritizing student freedom over wellbeing
2. [ ] B) They are not fulfilling their responsibility to protect students
3. [ ] C) They are waiting for more research evidence
4. [ ] D) They are allowing parents to make the decision
5. [ ] E) They have better solutions to address student wellbeing

**Solution:**
> • The passage states that 'Schools have a responsibility to create environments where young people can thrive' and that phone bans are about 'giving students back what they are losing: their childhood.'
• The author presents evidence of harm caused by phone use during breaks (loneliness, reduced physical activity, increased stress) and shows successful outcomes from schools that have implemented bans.
• By emphasizing schools' responsibility and providing evidence that phones harm student wellbeing, the author implies that schools without bans are failing to meet their duty.
• Therefore, the answer is B because the author believes schools have a responsibility to protect students, and not banning phones means they are not fulfilling this responsibility.

> Read the passage and answer the question.

What does the author suggest about the current education system by calling the four-day week 'a sensible evolution of our outdated educational model'?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) The education system has never been updated before
2. [ ] B) The current five-day model no longer meets modern needs
3. [ ] C) Schools should return to older teaching methods
4. [ ] D) The education system is completely broken
5. [ ] E) Teachers prefer traditional scheduling methods

• Throughout the passage, the author presents evidence about modern challenges (student stress, climate crisis, family disconnection) that the current system doesn't address well
• Therefore, the answer is B because the author is inferring that the five-day model was suitable in the past but no longer fits the needs of today's students, families, and society

• Later in the story, Mei's art successfully communicates who she is and wins first place, leading to friendship with Sophie
• The phrase 'speaks louder than words' is used figuratively to mean that art can communicate powerfully without verbal language
• Therefore, the answer is B because Mrs. Patterson is encouraging Mei by explaining that her paintings can express her identity and abilities even when verbal English is difficult for her

Passage: The Ancient City Beneath the Waves: Discovering Thonis-Heracleion

For over a thousand years, an entire city lay hidden beneath the Mediterranean Sea. This lost city, called Thonis-Heracleion, was once a bustling port in ancient Egypt. Today, archaeologists are uncovering its secrets and learning how people lived more than 2,000 years ago.

Thonis-Heracleion was located near the mouth of the Nile River. It served as Egypt's main gateway for trade with Greece and other Mediterranean countries. Ships carrying grain, papyrus, and precious stones would dock at its busy harbour. The city was home to grand temples, towering statues, and wealthy merchants. Ancient Greek historians even wrote about visiting this important trading centre.

Sometime around the eighth century CE, the city disappeared. Scientists believe several natural disasters caused Thonis-Heracleion to sink into the sea. The soft clay and sand beneath the city became unstable. Earthquakes shook the ground, making buildings collapse. Tidal waves crashed over the streets. Slowly, the entire city slipped underwater and was covered by sand and mud.

For centuries, people forgot about Thonis-Heracleion. Some historians thought it was just a myth, a story that ancient writers had invented. However, in 2000, French archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team made an extraordinary discovery. Using special underwater equipment, they found the ruins of the lost city in Aboukir Bay, about 6.5 kilometres off Egypt's northern coast.

The underwater city is remarkably well preserved. Divers have found massive stone statues of Egyptian gods and pharaohs, some standing over five metres tall. They have recovered thousands of gold coins, jewellery, and bronze objects. Ancient ships still rest on the seabed, their wooden hulls intact after centuries underwater. Stone anchors and pottery jars reveal details about ancient trade routes and daily life.

One of the most significant discoveries was the remains of a huge temple dedicated to the god Amun-Gereb. Archaeologists found enormous blocks of stone, columns, and religious objects scattered across the seafloor. These findings help researchers understand ancient Egyptian religious practices and beliefs.

Exploring Thonis-Heracleion is challenging work. Divers can only stay underwater for limited periods. The water is murky, making visibility poor. Moving heavy stone objects from the seabed requires careful planning and special equipment. Despite these difficulties, archaeologists continue their work, bringing up new treasures each year.

The discovery of Thonis-Heracleion reminds us that our planet still holds many secrets. It shows how natural forces can dramatically change landscapes and hide entire civilisations. By studying this sunken city, we gain valuable knowledge about ancient trade, religion, and architecture.

Passage: The Ancient City Beneath the Waves: Discovering Thonis-Heracleion

For over a thousand years, an entire city lay hidden beneath the Mediterranean Sea. This lost city, called Thonis-Heracleion, was once a bustling port in ancient Egypt. Today, archaeologists are uncovering its secrets and learning how people lived more than 2,000 years ago.

Thonis-Heracleion was located near the mouth of the Nile River. It served as Egypt's main gateway for trade with Greece and other Mediterranean countries. Ships carrying grain, papyrus, and precious stones would dock at its busy harbour. The city was home to grand temples, towering statues, and wealthy merchants. Ancient Greek historians even wrote about visiting this important trading centre.

Sometime around the eighth century CE, the city disappeared. Scientists believe several natural disasters caused Thonis-Heracleion to sink into the sea. The soft clay and sand beneath the city became unstable. Earthquakes shook the ground, making buildings collapse. Tidal waves crashed over the streets. Slowly, the entire city slipped underwater and was covered by sand and mud.

For centuries, people forgot about Thonis-Heracleion. Some historians thought it was just a myth, a story that ancient writers had invented. However, in 2000, French archaeologist Franck Goddio and his team made an extraordinary discovery. Using special underwater equipment, they found the ruins of the lost city in Aboukir Bay, about 6.5 kilometres off Egypt's northern coast.

The underwater city is remarkably well preserved. Divers have found massive stone statues of Egyptian gods and pharaohs, some standing over five metres tall. They have recovered thousands of gold coins, jewellery, and bronze objects. Ancient ships still rest on the seabed, their wooden hulls intact after centuries underwater. Stone anchors and pottery jars reveal details about ancient trade routes and daily life.

One of the most significant discoveries was the remains of a huge temple dedicated to the god Amun-Gereb. Archaeologists found enormous blocks of stone, columns, and religious objects scattered across the seafloor. These findings help researchers understand ancient Egyptian religious practices and beliefs.

Exploring Thonis-Heracleion is challenging work. Divers can only stay underwater for limited periods. The water is murky, making visibility poor. Moving heavy stone objects from the seabed requires careful planning and special equipment. Despite these difficulties, archaeologists continue their work, bringing up new treasures each year.

The discovery of Thonis-Heracleion reminds us that our planet still holds many secrets. It shows how natural forces can dramatically change landscapes and hide entire civilisations. By studying this sunken city, we gain valuable knowledge about ancient trade, religion, and architecture. Each object brought to the surface adds another piece to the puzzle of human history, helping us understand how our ancestors lived, worked, and built their remarkable world.

The huge temple found underwater was dedicated to:
A) Egyptian pharaohs
B) Amun-Gereb
C) Greek gods
D) Mediterranean traders

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) Egyptian pharaohs
2. [ ] B) Amun-Gereb
3. [ ] C) Greek gods
4. [ ] D) Mediterranean traders

**Solution:**
> • The passage explicitly states: 'One of the most significant discoveries was the remains of a huge temple dedicated to the god Amun-Gereb.'
• This information is clearly stated in the sixth paragraph.
• Therefore, the answer is B because the passage directly identifies Amun-Gereb as the god to whom the huge temple was dedicated.

Passage: The Secret Language of Bees

When a honeybee discovers a patch of flowers rich with nectar, it faces an important challenge. How can it tell thousands of other bees in the hive exactly where to find this food? The answer lies in one of nature's most fascinating communication systems: the waggle dance.

Karl von Frisch, an Austrian scientist, first decoded this bee language in the 1940s. He observed that when a forager bee returns to the hive, it performs a special figure-eight dance on the honeycomb. Other bees gather around closely, touching the dancer with their antennae to understand the message. This discovery was so significant that von Frisch won the Nobel Prize in 1973.

The waggle dance contains precise information about distance and direction. When a bee waggles its body in a straight line, the angle of this line indicates direction. If the bee dances straight up the honeycomb, the flowers are in the direction of the sun. If the bee dances at an angle to the right, other bees must fly at that same angle from the sun's position. The sun acts like a compass in the sky.

Distance information is equally clever. The length of the waggle run tells other bees how far they must travel. A short waggle means the flowers are nearby, perhaps 50 metres away. A longer, more vigorous waggle indicates a journey of several kilometres. The bee also communicates the quality of the food source through the enthusiasm of its dance. Better nectar sources inspire more energetic performances.

Bees can even adjust their dance for the sun's movement across the sky. Since the sun changes position throughout the day, bees update their directional instructions accordingly. This shows remarkable mental ability for such a small creature. A bee's brain is smaller than a grain of rice, yet it can perform complex calculations.

This communication system benefits the entire colony. Instead of thousands of bees searching randomly, they work as an efficient team. Bees can share information about flowers up to six kilometres away. This organised approach helps the hive collect enough nectar to produce honey and feed the colony, including the queen and developing larvae.

Scientists continue to study bee communication today. Recent research shows that bees can also communicate about water sources and new nesting sites. Some studies suggest that bees might even have regional dialects, with different populations using slightly different dance patterns. Understanding how bees share information helps us appreciate their intelligence and reminds us why protecting bee populations matters. These tiny dancers play a vital role in pollinating crops and maintaining healthy ecosystems around the world.

Karl von Frisch won the Nobel Prize in:
A) 1940
B) 1973
C) 1928
D) 1950

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) 1940
2. [ ] B) 1973
3. [ ] C) 1928
4. [ ] D) 1950

**Solution:**
> • The passage states that Karl von Frisch first decoded bee language in the 1940s
• It then explicitly states: 'This discovery was so significant that von Frisch won the Nobel Prize in 1973'
• Therefore, the answer is B because the passage directly states he won the Nobel Prize in 1973

Passage:
Why Every Student Deserves a Musical Education
When school budgets are tight, music programmes are often the first to face the axe. This is a grave mistake that threatens the future of our children and our society.

Music education is not a luxury—it is a necessity. Research from universities worldwide consistently demonstrates that students who participate in music programmes perform better academically across all subjects. A landmark study involving over 100,000 students found that those who learnt musical instruments scored an average of 20% higher in mathematics and science tests. Why? Because music trains the brain to recognise patterns, maintain focus, and solve complex problems. These are precisely the skills that employers desperately seek in today's workforce.

Yet some administrators argue that music is merely entertainment, a pleasant distraction from 'real' learning. How short-sighted can we be? Would we dismiss mathematics because not every student becomes an engineer? Of course not. Music develops critical thinking, discipline, and creativity—qualities essential for success in any career path.

Consider the economic argument. Critics claim music programmes cost too much, but what price do we place on a child's potential? The instruments, teachers, and facilities required for music education cost less than many sports programmes, yet music receives a fraction of the funding. Schools routinely spend thousands on football equipment, but baulk at purchasing violins or hiring qualified music teachers. This reveals a troubling bias in our priorities.

Moreover, music education promotes mental health and emotional wellbeing. In an era where teenage anxiety and depression have reached alarming levels, music provides a vital outlet for self-expression and stress relief. Students who play instruments or sing in choirs report higher levels of confidence and stronger social connections. They learn teamwork through orchestras and bands, discovering how individual contributions create something greater than themselves.

The cultural benefits cannot be ignored either. Music connects us to our heritage and helps us understand diverse cultures. When students learn folk songs from different countries or explore various musical traditions, they develop empathy and global awareness. In our increasingly interconnected world, these qualities are invaluable.

Some argue that students can learn music outside school through private lessons. But this creates inequality. Only wealthy families can afford private tuition, meaning that talented children from disadvantaged backgrounds miss opportunities to develop their gifts. School music programmes level the playing field, ensuring every child—regardless of family income—can access this transformative education.

The evidence is overwhelming and the moral case is clear. We must prioritise music education in our schools, not as an optional extra, but as a fundamental component of every student's development. Our children deserve nothing less than a complete education—one that nurtures their minds, hearts, and souls. Will we give it to them?

Why are music programmes usually cut first when school budgets are reduced?
A) Music teachers are too expensive to employ
B) Schools consider music less important than other subjects
C) Music instruments require too much maintenance
D) Students prefer sports programmes over music
E) Music education does not improve academic performance

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) Music teachers are too expensive to employ
2. [ ] B) Schools consider music less important than other subjects
3. [ ] C) Music instruments require too much maintenance
4. [ ] D) Students prefer sports programmes over music
5. [ ] E) Music education does not improve academic performance

**Solution:**
> • The passage states that music programmes are 'often the first to face the axe' when budgets are tight
• The passage mentions that administrators argue music is 'merely entertainment' and a distraction from 'real' learning
• The passage also notes that schools spend thousands on sports equipment but 'baulk at purchasing violins', revealing 'a troubling bias in our priorities'
• Therefore, the answer is B because these details indicate that schools consider music less important than other subjects, which is why it gets cut first during budget reductions

Passage:
The Colour of Courage
Mei pressed her forehead against the cool window of the train, watching the Australian countryside blur into streaks of gold and green. In three hours, she would stand on stage at the National Youth Poetry Competition in Melbourne. Her stomach twisted like a pretzel.

"You haven't touched your sandwich," her grandmother said softly in Mandarin, gesturing to the untouched lunch on the fold-down table.

Mei shook her head. "I can't eat, Nǎinai. What if I forget my poem? What if people laugh at my accent?"

Her grandmother's weathered hands reached across and gently covered Mei's trembling fingers. "Tell me again why you wrote 'Two Voices'."

Mei sighed. She had written the poem after a difficult term at her new school in Sydney. Some students had mocked the way she pronounced certain English words, even though she had lived in Australia for three years. The poem explored living between two languages, two cultures, feeling like she belonged fully to neither.

"I wrote it because... because I needed to say something true," Mei whispered.

"Then that is all that matters." Her grandmother smiled, the corners of her eyes crinkling like tissue paper. "When I came to Australia fifty years ago, I was so frightened of my broken English that I barely spoke for months. I let fear steal my voice."

Mei looked up, surprised. Her grandmother always seemed so confident, chatting with neighbours and shopkeepers without hesitation.

"But you speak English perfectly now."

"Now, yes. But I wasted so much time being silent when I had important things to say." Nǎinai squeezed Mei's hand. "You have found your voice early. That is a gift. Don't hide it because others might not understand its beauty immediately."

The train announcer's voice crackled overhead: "Arriving at Southern Cross Station in fifteen minutes."

Mei's heart hammered. She pulled out her notebook, its pages worn soft from constant handling. The poem stared back at her, each word a small act of bravery she had committed to paper months ago.

At the venue, backstage smelled of floor polish and nervous energy. Twelve other young poets waited in the wings, some rehearsing silently, others chatting to calm their nerves. Mei stood apart, breathing deeply like her drama teacher had taught her.

"Contestant number seven, Mei Chen, please take the stage."

Her legs felt like jelly as she walked into the spotlight. The audience was a dark sea of faces. She gripped the microphone, and for one terrible moment, her mind went completely blank.

Then she saw Nǎinai in the third row, sitting straight-backed and proud, nodding encouragement.

Mei closed her eyes briefly, found the first line floating in her memory, and began. Her voice shook on the opening words, but as she continued, something shifted. The poem wasn't just words anymore—it was her truth, her experience, her two voices blending into something uniquely hers.

When she finished, silence hung in the air for a heartbeat. Then applause erupted, warm and genuine. Mei saw tears on some faces, smiles on others. A girl in the front row gave her a thumbs up.

Backstage afterwards, Mei didn't win first place, but she had won something more valuable. A judge approached her, saying, "Your poem made me think about my own grandmother's journey. Thank you for sharing your voice."

On the train home, Mei finally ate her sandwich. Nǎinai dozed beside her, and Mei watched the countryside roll past, thinking about courage. It wasn't about being unafraid. It was about speaking your truth even when your voice shook, about sharing your story even when you worried it might not be understood.

She pulled out her notebook and began writing a new poem.

What can we infer about why Mei's notebook pages were "worn soft from constant handling"?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) The notebook was very old and had been used for many years
2. [ ] B) Mei had been practicing and reviewing her poem repeatedly
3. [ ] C) The notebook was made from poor quality paper
4. [ ] D) Mei had written many different poems in the notebook
5. [ ] E) The notebook had been damaged during her journey

**Solution:**
> • The passage describes Mei pulling out her notebook just before arriving at the competition venue
• The notebook's pages are described as "worn soft from constant handling" immediately before mentioning the poem she would perform
• Earlier, Mei expressed fears about forgetting her poem, suggesting she would need to practice it many times
• Therefore, the answer is B because the worn condition of the pages indicates Mei had been repeatedly practicing and reviewing her poem in preparation for the competition

Every week, another green space disappears beneath concrete and steel. Developers promise progress, but what they deliver is the destruction of our community's lungs. We must act now to protect our neighbourhood parks before they vanish forever.

Parks are not luxuries—they are necessities. Research from the University of Melbourne shows that children who play in green spaces for at least one hour daily perform 20% better academically and demonstrate significantly lower stress levels. These aren't just statistics; they represent real students achieving their potential because they had somewhere to run, climb, and breathe fresh air.

Yet developers continue to target our parks. They claim that new apartment buildings will solve housing shortages, but at what cost? When Marrickville Council sold Patterson Park to developers in 2019, local doctors reported a 35% increase in childhood obesity within two years. The park had been the community's free gymnasium, its outdoor classroom, its meeting place. Now it's a carpark.

Some argue that we need housing more than parks. This argument presents a false choice. Cities like Singapore have proven that we can build upwards whilst preserving green spaces. Their Housing Development Board mandates that every neighbourhood must have parkland within 400 metres of residential buildings. Why can't Australian councils adopt similar policies?

Consider the economic benefits too. Properties near parks sell for 15% more than identical homes without park access. Parks increase property values for entire neighbourhoods, generating higher council rates that fund community services. Destroying parks for short-term development gains is economically foolish.

Moretheless, the environmental argument remains most compelling. Urban parks reduce air pollution, lower temperatures during heatwaves, and provide crucial habitats for native wildlife. As climate change intensifies, these green spaces become even more vital. Removing them is like throwing away a life jacket whilst the waters rise around us.

What can we do? First, attend council meetings and voice opposition to park developments. Second, sign petitions and encourage neighbours to do likewise. Third, support councillors who prioritise green space protection. Our voices matter—when Leichhardt residents protested the proposed sale of Pioneer Park, the council reversed its decision within three weeks.

Parks belong to everyone. They don't discriminate based on wealth, age, or background. A child in public housing enjoys the same swings as a child from a mansion. This equality is precious and rare.

We stand at a crossroads. We can allow developers to pave over our green spaces, or we can fight for our children's right to nature. The choice seems obvious. Our parks are worth fighting for—because once they're gone, they're gone forever. Will you join the fight?

What can be inferred about the relationship between Patterson Park and childhood obesity rates?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) The park caused obesity to decrease by 35%
2. [ ] B) Children lost access to physical activity when the park was removed
3. [ ] C) The park had special equipment to prevent obesity
4. [ ] D) Doctors built new clinics after the park was sold
5. [ ] E) The carpark provided better exercise facilities

**Solution:**
> • The passage states that Patterson Park had been the community's 'free gymnasium' and after it became a carpark, childhood obesity increased by 35%
• This suggests children were using the park for physical activity and exercise
• When the park was removed, children no longer had this space for physical activity, leading to increased obesity
• Therefore, the answer is B because the increase in obesity after the park's removal indicates that children lost access to physical activity opportunities that the park had provided

What can be inferred about the Leichhardt residents' protest mentioned in the passage?

A) It lasted for several months before achieving results
B) Community action can successfully influence council decisions
C) The council had already sold Pioneer Park to developers
D) Most residents did not support the park's protection
E) The protest was unsuccessful in saving the park

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) It lasted for several months before achieving results
2. [ ] B) Community action can successfully influence council decisions
3. [ ] C) The council had already sold Pioneer Park to developers
4. [ ] D) Most residents did not support the park's protection
5. [ ] E) The protest was unsuccessful in saving the park

**Solution:**
> • The passage states that when Leichhardt residents protested the proposed sale of Pioneer Park, the council reversed its decision within three weeks.
• This example is presented in the context of showing readers that their voices matter and what they can do to protect parks.
• The quick reversal of the council's decision demonstrates that community action was effective in influencing the outcome.
• Therefore, the answer is B because the example shows that organized community action can successfully change council decisions about park development.

**Question:**
> Read the passage and answer the question.

The author compares Singapore's approach to urban development with Australian councils to highlight:
A) Population density differences
B) Different building techniques
C) The possibility of combining housing and parks
D) Economic development strategies

**Solution:**
> • The passage states: 'Some argue that we need housing more than parks. This argument presents a false choice.'
• The author then uses Singapore as an example: 'Cities like Singapore have proven that we can build upwards whilst preserving green spaces.'
• Singapore's Housing Development Board mandates parkland within 400 metres of residential buildings, demonstrating both housing and parks can coexist.
• The author asks 'Why can't Australian councils adopt similar policies?' showing the comparison is meant to prove housing and parks aren't mutually exclusive.
• Therefore, the answer is C because the comparison specifically shows that the choice between housing and parks is false—both can be achieved together.

**Question:**
> Read the passage and answer the question.

According to the passage, the author compares music programmes with sports programmes to show that:
A) Music programmes cost more than sports programmes
B) Sports programmes are more popular than music programmes
C) Music programmes receive less funding despite similar or lower costs
D) Sports and music programmes both develop teamwork skills
E) Music programmes have better academic outcomes than sports programmes

**Solution:**

• The author then provides an example: 'Schools routinely spend thousands on football equipment, but baulk at purchasing violins or hiring qualified music teachers.'
• This comparison is used to demonstrate the funding inequality between the two programmes, showing music receives less funding despite costing the same or less.
• Therefore, the answer is C because the author's comparison highlights that music programmes receive disproportionately less funding even though they don't cost more than sports programmes.

**Question:**

Poem: 'The Lighthouse Keeper's Daughter'

She stands where the wild wind whispers,
Where the sea speaks in silver tongues.
Her father tends the turning light—
A beacon burning bright and young.

Each evening as the sun slips down,
She climbs the spiralling stair of stone,
Counting steps like counted days,
In this tower that she calls home.

The waves below are restless dancers,
Leaping, laughing, crashing white.
They call to her with salty songs
Of distant shores and endless flight.

But she must stay, her duty clear,
To polish glass and trim the flame,
To watch for ships that lose their way
When fog rolls in like winter's shame.

Sometimes she dreams of city streets,
Of crowded markets, music, friends—
A life beyond this lonely rock
Where ocean starts and shoreline ends.

Yet when the storm clouds gather close,
And sailors strain to see the shore,
She knows her light means life itself—
A guiding star worth waiting for.

She stands where two worlds meet and blend:
The solid earth, the shifting sea.
Between the known and the unknown,
She finds out who she's meant to be.

What are the waves compared to in the poem?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) Silver tongues
2. [ ] B) Restless dancers
3. [ ] C) Salty songs
4. [ ] D) A guiding star
5. [ ] E) Winter's shame

**Solution:**
> • The poem describes 'The waves below are restless dancers, / Leaping, laughing, crashing white.'
• This line directly compares the waves to dancers through a metaphor.
• The other options refer to different images in the poem: silver tongues (how the sea speaks), salty songs (what the waves call with), a guiding star (the lighthouse light), and winter's shame (the fog).
• Therefore, the answer is B because the waves are explicitly compared to 'restless dancers' in the third stanza.

Passage:
The Mystery of the Terracotta Army
In 1974, Chinese farmers digging a well near the city of Xi'an made an extraordinary discovery. They uncovered pieces of clay that turned out to be parts of life-sized soldiers. This accidental find led archaeologists to one of the greatest archaeological treasures in history: the Terracotta Army.

The Terracotta Army is a collection of thousands of clay soldiers buried underground for over 2,000 years. These statues were created to protect China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, in the afterlife. The emperor ruled from 221 to 210 BCE and united China's warring states into one empire. He believed that an army of clay warriors would serve him after death, just as real soldiers served him during his lifetime.

What makes the Terracotta Army truly remarkable is its enormous scale and incredible detail. Archaeologists have found more than 8,000 soldiers so far, along with 130 chariots and 670 horses. Each figure stands about 180 centimetres tall and weighs approximately 200 kilograms. The soldiers are arranged in battle formation, with infantry, cavalry, and archers positioned as they would be in a real army.

Even more impressive is that no two soldiers look exactly alike. Each statue has unique facial features, hairstyles, and expressions. Some soldiers appear young, while others look older and more experienced. Their uniforms indicate different ranks, from generals to foot soldiers. This attention to detail suggests that the sculptors may have modelled the figures on actual members of the emperor's army.

Creating the Terracotta Army required tremendous effort and resources. Historians estimate that approximately 700,000 workers laboured for nearly 40 years to complete the project. The statues were made using local clay, which workers shaped by hand before firing in kilns. Originally, the figures were painted in bright colours including red, green, and purple. However, exposure to air caused most of the paint to fade within minutes of excavation.

The tomb complex covers an area of about 98 square kilometres, making it larger than many modern cities. Despite decades of excavation, archaeologists have only explored a small portion of the site. The emperor's actual burial chamber remains unopened. Ancient texts describe it as containing rivers of mercury and a ceiling decorated with pearls representing stars. Scientists have detected high mercury levels in the soil, suggesting these descriptions might be accurate.

Today, the Terracotta Army attracts millions of visitors annually and is recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It provides valuable insights into ancient Chinese military organisation, artistic techniques, and burial customs. The discovery continues to reveal new information about one of history's most powerful civilisations and the emperor who shaped China's future.

The Terracotta Army was discovered in 1974 by:
A) archaeologists searching for ancient sites

Passage:
How Cities Keep Cool: The Urban Heat Island Effect
On a hot summer night, city dwellers often notice something unusual. The temperature in the city centre feels much warmer than in nearby parks or countryside. This difference is not imaginary. It is caused by what scientists call the urban heat island effect.

An urban heat island forms when a city becomes significantly warmer than the rural areas surrounding it. The temperature difference can be quite dramatic. Some cities are up to seven degrees Celsius hotter than their surroundings. This extra heat affects millions of people living in urban areas around the world.

Several factors create this heat island effect. Dark surfaces like roads and rooftops absorb sunlight during the day. These surfaces then release the stored heat at night. Concrete and asphalt hold much more heat than soil or grass. Buildings also trap heat by blocking wind that would normally cool an area. Additionally, air conditioners and vehicles release warm air into city streets. All these elements combine to make cities noticeably warmer.

The consequences of urban heat islands impact daily life in many ways. Higher temperatures mean people use more electricity to cool their homes and offices. This increased energy use costs more money and creates more pollution. Hot cities also affect human health. Elderly people and young children struggle more in extreme heat. Some people develop heat-related illnesses during summer heatwaves. The extra warmth can even change local weather patterns, sometimes causing more thunderstorms.

Fortunately, cities can take action to reduce these heat islands. Planting trees provides natural shade and cooling. Trees release water vapour through their leaves, which helps lower air temperature. Some cities paint rooftops white or install special reflective materials. These light-coloured surfaces bounce sunlight away instead of absorbing it. Creating more parks and green spaces also helps. Grass and plants stay much cooler than concrete.

Singapore offers an excellent example of heat island solutions. The city has planted trees along most streets and created rooftop gardens on buildings. Melbourne has increased its tree canopy and built more parks. Los Angeles has started painting some streets with light-grey coating. These projects show promising results.

Understanding urban heat islands matters now more than ever. The world's population continues to grow, with more people moving to cities each year. Climate change is also making summers hotter in many regions. By learning about heat islands and their solutions, communities can create cooler, healthier, and more comfortable urban environments. Simple changes like planting trees and using lighter building materials can make a real difference. Cities do not have to be heat traps. With careful planning and smart design, urban areas can stay cooler for everyone.

According to the passage, some cities can be up to how many degrees Celsius hotter than their surroundings?
A) Three degrees Celsius
B) Five degrees Celsius
C) Seven degrees Celsius
D) Ten degrees Celsius
E) Twelve degrees Celsius

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) Three degrees Celsius
2. [ ] B) Five degrees Celsius
3. [ ] C) Seven degrees Celsius
4. [ ] D) Ten degrees Celsius
5. [ ] E) Twelve degrees Celsius

Passage: Why Schools Must Ban Homework for Primary Students

Every evening, millions of children around the world sit at kitchen tables, struggling through homework instead of playing, exploring or simply being children. It's time we asked ourselves a crucial question: does homework for primary school students actually help them learn, or is it doing more harm than good?

The evidence is clear. Research from leading universities shows that homework provides no academic benefit for primary-aged children. A comprehensive study by Duke University found that homework in primary school has zero correlation with academic achievement. Zero. Yet we continue to burden young students with worksheets and assignments that steal precious hours from their childhood. Why do we persist with a practice that science tells us doesn't work?

Consider what children lose when homework dominates their evenings. They lose time for creative play, which experts agree is essential for brain development. They lose opportunities for physical activity, contributing to rising childhood obesity rates. They lose quality time with family, something that research consistently links to better mental health and stronger social skills. Are we really willing to sacrifice all of this for a practice that delivers no educational benefits?

Furthermore, homework creates unnecessary stress and anxiety in young children. Paediatricians report increasing numbers of primary students experiencing headaches, stomach aches and sleep problems directly related to homework pressure. Some children as young as seven years old cry over assignments they don't understand, whilst their exhausted parents struggle to help after their own long working days. This isn't education; it's cruelty.

Some argue that homework teaches responsibility and time management. But children learn these skills through age-appropriate activities like caring for pets, helping with household tasks, and managing their own belongings. They don't need worksheets to develop life skills.

Countries like Finland, which consistently ranks among the world's best education systems, assign minimal homework in primary years. Their students spend afternoons playing outdoors, pursuing hobbies and spending time with family. They arrive at school refreshed, curious and eager to learn. Meanwhile, in countries drowning students in homework, we see increased anxiety, decreased motivation and no improvement in actual learning outcomes.

The solution is simple and supported by evidence: ban homework for all primary school students. Let children be children. Let them play, explore, rest and grow. Let families enjoy their evenings together without the constant shadow of unfinished assignments. Our children deserve better than a system that wastes their time and damages their wellbeing for zero educational gain. It's time for schools to listen to the research, show courage, and make this essential change.

What can be inferred about why schools continue to assign homework despite the research findings?

A) Schools are unaware that homework causes stress in children
B) Schools are following tradition rather than evidence
C) Schools believe homework improves physical health
D) Schools want to teach responsibility through worksheets
E) Schools are copying the Finnish education system

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) Schools are unaware that homework causes stress in children

Passage: Why Schools Must Ban Homework for Primary Students

Every evening, millions of children around the world sit at kitchen tables, struggling through homework instead of playing, exploring or simply being children. It's time we asked ourselves a crucial question: does homework for primary school students actually help them learn, or is it doing more harm than good?

The evidence is clear. Research from leading universities shows that homework provides no academic benefit for primary-aged children. A comprehensive study by Duke University found that homework in primary school has zero correlation with academic achievement. Zero. Yet we continue to burden young students with worksheets and assignments that steal precious hours from their childhood. Why do we persist with a practice that science tells us doesn't work?

Consider what children lose when homework dominates their evenings. They lose time for creative play, which experts agree is essential for brain development. They lose opportunities for physical activity, contributing to rising childhood obesity rates. They lose quality time with family, something that research consistently links to better mental health and stronger social skills. Are we really willing to sacrifice all of this for a practice that delivers no educational benefits?

Furthermore, homework creates unnecessary stress and anxiety in young children. Paediatricians report increasing numbers of primary students experiencing headaches, stomach aches and sleep problems directly related to homework pressure. Some children as young as seven years old cry over assignments they don't understand, whilst their exhausted parents struggle to help after their own long working days. This isn't education; it's cruelty.

Some argue that homework teaches responsibility and time management. But children learn these skills through age-appropriate activities like caring for pets, helping with household tasks, and managing their own belongings. They don't need worksheets to develop life skills.

Countries like Finland, which consistently ranks among the world's best education systems, assign minimal homework in primary years. Their students spend afternoons playing outdoors, pursuing hobbies and spending time with family. They arrive at school refreshed, curious and eager to learn. Meanwhile, in countries drowning students in homework, we see increased anxiety, decreased motivation and no improvement in actual learning outcomes.

The solution is simple and supported by evidence: ban homework for all primary school students. Let children be children. Let them play, explore, rest and grow. Let families enjoy their evenings together without the constant shadow of unfinished assignments. Our children deserve better than a system that wastes their time and damages their wellbeing for zero educational gain. It's time for schools to listen to the research, show courage, and make this essential change.

What can be inferred about Finnish students' attitude towards learning?

A) They dislike school because they have no homework
B) They are more motivated to learn than students with heavy homework
C) They perform poorly due to lack of homework practice
D) They spend too much time playing outdoors
E) They need more homework to develop responsibility

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) They dislike school because they have no homework
2. [ ] B) They are more motivated to learn than students with heavy homework
3. [ ] C) They perform poorly due to lack of homework practice
4. [ ] D) They spend too much time playing outdoors
5. [ ] E) They need more homework to develop responsibility

**Solution:**
> • The passage states that Finnish students 'arrive at school refreshed, curious and eager to learn'
• It contrasts this with countries that give heavy homework, where students show 'increased anxiety, decreased motivation'
• The words 'curious' and 'eager to learn' indicate positive motivation towards learning
• Therefore, the answer is B because Finnish students with minimal homework demonstrate greater motivation and enthusiasm for learning compared to students burdened with heavy homework

• Immediately after the story, Nani brings materials to make a lantern together, turning Maya's disappointment into something positive
• Therefore, the answer is B because Nani shared her story to comfort Maya and help her cope with the disappointment of missing the parade

• At the end, Maya learns an important lesson: 'She finally understood what her great-grandfather had meant. The lantern's journey wasn't about where it went, but about the moment of creating it, of trying despite obstacles.' She also says: 'For showing me that missing something doesn't mean losing everything.'
• Therefore, the answer is B because the passage shows Maya's transformation from feeling she had lost the parade experience to understanding she had gained something more valuable through creating the lantern with her grandmother.

**Solution:**
> • The passage states: 'It lay 10 metres below the surface of Abu Qir Bay.'
• This directly tells us the depth at which the city was found.
• Therefore, the answer is B because the passage explicitly states the city was discovered 10 metres below the surface.

What can we infer about why Maya initially felt the colours on her palette seemed "dull and lifeless"?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) The paints were old and had dried out
2. [ ] B) Her emotional state affected how she perceived the colours
3. [ ] C) The afternoon light made the colours appear faded
4. [ ] D) Mrs Chen had given her the wrong type of paints
5. [ ] E) The other students had taken all the vibrant colours

**Solution:**
> • The passage states that Maya "had always found hope in colours—vibrant oranges like sunrise, deep blues like ocean depths"
• However, after her accident and loss of ability, she was feeling discouraged and thought "I can't do this"
• The colours themselves hadn't changed, but her perception of them had changed due to her emotional state of despair and self-doubt
• Therefore, the answer is B because Maya's feelings of hopelessness and discouragement affected how she saw the colours, making them seem dull when they were actually the same colours she once found hopeful

Passage: Why School Should Start Later: A Wake-Up Call for Better Learning

Every morning across our nation, millions of teenagers drag themselves out of bed in the darkness, fighting exhaustion as they prepare for another early school day. This daily struggle isn't just about being tired—it's about a system that ignores basic biology and damages our young people's health, learning, and future.

The science is crystal clear. Adolescent bodies naturally fall asleep later and need more rest than adults. During the teenage years, our internal body clocks shift, making it nearly impossible to fall asleep before 11 pm. Yet most secondary schools start at 8:30 am or earlier, forcing students to wake at 6 am or before. This creates a serious sleep deficit that accumulates throughout the week.

What are the consequences of this exhaustion? Research from the Australian Sleep Health Foundation shows that sleep-deprived teenagers perform significantly worse in tests, struggle with concentration, and have higher rates of anxiety and depression. A landmark American study involving over 9,000 students found that schools starting after 8:30 am saw dramatic improvements: better grades, fewer absences, and reduced car accidents among student drivers. These aren't minor benefits—they're life-changing outcomes.

Some argue that later start times would disrupt family schedules and after-school activities. But isn't our children's health worth some adjustment? Parents already rearrange their lives for countless school requirements. Sports practices can be rescheduled. The alternative—continuing to harm our teenagers' development—is simply unacceptable.

Why does the author believe that concerns about disrupting family schedules are not strong enough to prevent later school start times?
A) Because family schedules are not important
B) Because parents already make adjustments for school requirements
C) Because after-school activities should be cancelled
D) Because teenagers can manage their own schedules

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) Because family schedules are not important
2. [ ] B) Because parents already make adjustments for school requirements
3. [ ] C) Because after-school activities should be cancelled
4. [ ] D) Because teenagers can manage their own schedules

**Solution:**
> • The passage states that parents already rearrange their lives for countless school requirements
• The author uses this point to argue that additional adjustments for later start times are reasonable
• The author implies that if parents can already make adjustments, they can make this one too, especially since children's health is at stake
• Therefore, the answer is B because the author believes parents' existing pattern of making school-related adjustments shows that concerns about disruption are manageable

What can be inferred about the author's view of arguments against later school start times?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) The author believes they are valid concerns that need careful consideration
2. [ ] B) The author dismisses them as less important than student health
3. [ ] C) The author agrees that family schedules cannot be changed
4. [ ] D) The author thinks sports activities are more important than sleep
5. [ ] E) The author has not considered these arguments

**Solution:**
> • The author acknowledges that some people argue later start times would disrupt family schedules and after-school activities
• The author then asks 'But isn't our children's health worth some adjustment?' and states the alternative is 'simply unacceptable'
• This rhetorical questioning and strong language shows the author considers these concerns less important than student health
• Therefore, the answer is B because the author dismisses these arguments as secondary to the health and wellbeing of students

Passage: Why Every Student Deserves a Musical Education

Walk into any school during budget planning season and you will hear the same tired argument: music programmes are luxuries we cannot afford. When money is tight, music classes are the first to be cut. This short-sighted approach is damaging our children's futures, and it must stop now.

Music education is not a luxury—it is a necessity. Research from universities across the globe consistently shows that students who study music perform better in mathematics, reading and science. Why? Because learning an instrument strengthens the brain's ability to recognise patterns, process information and solve complex problems. When a child learns to read music, they are actually training their brain to think in multiple dimensions simultaneously. These are skills that benefit every subject, every career and every aspect of life.

Yet despite this overwhelming evidence, schools continue to treat music as an optional extra. In the past decade, thousands of music programmes have disappeared from schools worldwide. Instruments gather dust in storage rooms whilst students miss out on opportunities that could transform their lives. Is this really the future we want for our children?

Consider the facts. Students involved in music programmes attend school more regularly and are less likely to drop out. They develop discipline, patience and teamwork—qualities that employers desperately seek. A recent study of business leaders found that 90% had musical training during their school years. Coincidence? Hardly.

What can be inferred about why schools cut music programmes first when budgets are tight?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) Schools believe music programmes are the most expensive to run
2. [ ] B) Schools view music programmes as less essential than other subjects
3. [ ] C) Schools want to punish students who do not perform well academically
4. [ ] D) Schools prefer to invest in sporting programmes instead
5. [ ] E) Schools lack qualified music teachers

**Solution:**
> • The passage states that during budget planning, the 'same tired argument' is heard: music programmes are 'luxuries we cannot afford'
• The passage also mentions that schools 'continue to treat music as an optional extra' despite evidence of its benefits
• The author calls this approach 'short-sighted', indicating schools prioritise other subjects over music
• Therefore, the answer is B because schools view music as less essential or necessary compared to other subjects, treating it as a luxury that can be eliminated when money is tight

**Question:**

What can we infer about Mrs Chen's reason for sharing her personal story with Maya?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) She wanted to prove that arthritis doesn't affect art skills
2. [ ] B) She wanted to show Maya that artists can adapt and succeed despite physical limitations
3. [ ] C) She was trying to convince Maya to become a teacher instead of an artist
4. [ ] D) She wanted to demonstrate that Japanese art concepts are superior
5. [ ] E) She was explaining why the community centre needed new equipment

**Solution:**
> • Mrs Chen shared that she broke her dominant hand at Maya's age and thought her art dreams were finished
• She then explained that art lives in the heart and mind, not just the hand, and mentioned finding beauty in imperfection
• Mrs Chen shared this story immediately after Maya said 'I can't do this' and was about to give up
• Therefore, the answer is B because Mrs Chen was using her own experience of overcoming a hand injury to encourage Maya that physical limitations don't have to end artistic dreams—artists can adapt their methods and still create meaningful art

• After the accident, her new painting is explicitly described as 'wild and free' with lines that 'wavered' and colours that 'bled into each other unexpectedly' - showing it was 'not neat or controlled'
• The passage states: 'The painting wasn't neat or controlled—it was wild and free, like a sunset exploding across the sky'
• Therefore, the answer is C because the main contrast is between her previous controlled, neat style and her new wavering, free-flowing brushwork

Passage:
Votes for Women: The 1917 Suffrage March
This powerful photograph captures over 10,000 women marching down Fifth Avenue, New York, in October 1917. They carried banners demanding the right to vote. Notice their formal clothing—dresses, hats, and gloves—chosen deliberately to appear respectable and challenge claims that suffragettes were unladylike troublemakers. The organised rows and serious expressions show determination and discipline. Within three years, American women won voting rights.

The passage states that the women's clothing was chosen 'deliberately'. In this context, 'deliberately' DOES NOT mean:

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) intentionally
2. [ ] B) accidentally
3. [ ] C) purposefully
4. [ ] D) consciously
5. [ ] E) carefully

**Solution:**
> • The passage explains that the women chose their formal clothing 'deliberately to appear respectable and challenge claims that suffragettes were unladylike troublemakers'.
• This shows the clothing choice was planned and intentional, not random or by chance.
• 'Deliberately' means done consciously and intentionally, with purpose and care.
• Therefore, the answer is B because 'accidentally' is the opposite of deliberately—it means something done by chance without planning, which does NOT match the meaning of deliberately.

Passage:
How Bees Talk Without Words
When a honeybee finds a patch of flowers rich in nectar, it faces an important challenge. How can it tell thousands of other bees in the hive exactly where to fly? Amazingly, bees have developed a special dance language that shares precise directions with their colony.

The most famous bee communication is called the waggle dance. When a worker bee returns to the hive after finding food, it performs this dance on the vertical honeycomb. The bee walks in a figure-eight pattern, waggling its body vigorously in the middle section. Other bees gather around closely, touching the dancer with their antennae to understand the message.

The dance contains two crucial pieces of information: distance and direction. The length of time the bee waggles tells other bees how far they must fly. A short waggle means the flowers are nearby, perhaps only 50 metres away. A longer waggle indicates the food source is farther, possibly up to several kilometres from the hive. Scientists have discovered that bees are remarkably accurate in their distance measurements.

Direction is even more fascinating. Bees use the sun as their compass. If the bee waggles straight up the honeycomb, it means other bees should fly directly toward the sun. If the dance points downward, they should fly away from the sun. An angle to the left or right tells bees to fly at that exact angle relative to the sun's position. This system works even on cloudy days because bees can detect the sun's location through cloud cover.

Bees also communicate through smell and sound. When a dancing bee returns from flowers, it carries the scent of those particular plants on its body. Other bees smell this scent during the dance, helping them recognise the correct flowers when they arrive. The bee also produces buzzing sounds at specific frequencies, which may convey information about the quality of the food source.

This communication system is essential for the survival of the colony. A single hive contains between 20,000 and 80,000 bees, and they must work together efficiently to collect enough nectar and pollen. Without the waggle dance, bees would waste valuable energy searching randomly for food. Instead, they can fly directly to productive locations.

Scientists first decoded the waggle dance in the 1940s, but researchers continue to discover new details about bee communication. Recent studies show that bees can even learn improved dancing techniques from experienced bees, suggesting their language is more sophisticated than previously thought. Understanding how bees share information helps us appreciate these tiny insects and their complex social behaviour. It also reminds us that communication takes many forms in the natural world, not just human speech.

Scientists first decoded the waggle dance in the:

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) 1920s
2. [ ] B) 1940s
3. [ ] C) 1950s
4. [ ] D) 1970s

**Solution:**
> • The passage explicitly states: 'Scientists first decoded the waggle dance in the 1940s'
• This information is found in the second-to-last paragraph
• Therefore, the answer is B because the passage clearly identifies the 1940s as when scientists first decoded the waggle dance

Passage:
The Mystery of the Terracotta Army
In 1974, farmers digging a well in China made an incredible discovery. They found pieces of clay pottery that turned out to be part of an enormous underground army. This army was made of terracotta, a type of baked clay, and had been buried for over 2,000 years.

The Terracotta Army was created to protect China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, in the afterlife. Emperor Qin ruled from 221 to 210 BCE and united China's warring states into one empire. He believed that he would need protection after death, just as he did during his life. To prepare for this, he ordered the construction of thousands of life-sized clay soldiers.

Archaeologists have uncovered more than 8,000 terracotta figures so far. The army includes soldiers, horses, chariots, and even musicians. Each soldier is unique, with different facial features, hairstyles, and expressions. Some soldiers are kneeling with crossbows, while others are standing ready for battle. The tallest figures are the generals, who can be identified by their elaborate uniforms and headgear.

The creation of this army was an enormous task. Historians estimate that over 700,000 workers spent nearly 40 years building the emperor's tomb complex. Craftsmen used local clay to mould each figure's body parts separately. Arms, legs, and heads were made individually and then attached together. After assembly, the figures were fired in large kilns at high temperatures to make them hard and durable.

Originally, the terracotta soldiers were not grey as they appear today. Scientific tests have revealed traces of bright paint on the figures. The soldiers once wore colourful uniforms in shades of red, blue, green, and purple. Their faces had realistic skin tones, and their hair and beards were black. Unfortunately, when the figures were exposed to air after excavation, the paint quickly dried and flaked off within minutes.

The Terracotta Army was arranged in military formation inside three large pits. The main pit contains about 6,000 soldiers arranged in rows. The second pit holds cavalry units and war chariots. The third pit appears to be the command headquarters, with high-ranking officers. Wooden beams once covered the pits, creating underground chambers, but these beams collapsed over time.

Today, the site is a museum that attracts millions of visitors each year. Archaeologists continue to excavate carefully, using modern technology to preserve the figures better. They now spray special chemicals on newly uncovered soldiers to protect any remaining paint. Many parts of the tomb complex remain unexcavated, and experts believe more discoveries await beneath the ground. The Terracotta Army stands as a remarkable example of ancient Chinese art, engineering, and beliefs about life after death.

How many terracotta figures have archaeologists uncovered so far?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) About 6,000 figures
2. [ ] B) More than 8,000 figures
3. [ ] C) Over 700,000 figures

Passage:
The Mystery of the Terracotta Army
In 1974, farmers digging a well in China made an incredible discovery. They found pieces of clay pottery that turned out to be part of an enormous underground army. This army was made of terracotta, a type of baked clay, and had been buried for over 2,000 years.

The Terracotta Army was created to protect China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, in the afterlife. Emperor Qin ruled from 221 to 210 BCE and united China's warring states into one empire. He believed that he would need protection after death, just as he did during his life. To prepare for this, he ordered the construction of thousands of life-sized clay soldiers.

Archaeologists have uncovered more than 8,000 terracotta figures so far. The army includes soldiers, horses, chariots, and even musicians. Each soldier is unique, with different facial features, hairstyles, and expressions. Some soldiers are kneeling with crossbows, while others are standing ready for battle. The tallest figures are the generals, who can be identified by their elaborate uniforms and headgear.

The creation of this army was an enormous task. Historians estimate that over 700,000 workers spent nearly 40 years building the emperor's tomb complex. Craftsmen used local clay to mould each figure's body parts separately. Arms, legs, and heads were made individually and then attached together. After assembly, the figures were fired in large kilns at high temperatures to make them hard and durable.

Originally, the terracotta soldiers were not grey as they appear today. Scientific tests have revealed traces of bright paint on the figures. The soldiers once wore colourful uniforms in shades of red, blue, green, and purple. Their faces had realistic skin tones, and their hair and beards were black.

The Terracotta Army was discovered in 1974 by:
A) archaeologists
B) farmers
C) historians
D) museum workers
E) soldiers

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) archaeologists
2. [ ] B) farmers
3. [ ] C) historians
4. [ ] D) museum workers
5. [ ] E) soldiers

**Solution:**
> • The first paragraph explicitly states: 'In 1974, farmers digging a well in China made an incredible discovery.'
• The passage clearly identifies farmers as the people who discovered the Terracotta Army.
• Therefore, the answer is B because the passage directly states that farmers made the discovery while digging a well.

Passage:
Why Every Student Deserves a Later School Start Time
Every morning, millions of teenagers around the world drag themselves out of bed in the dark, fighting against their own biology to make it to school on time. This daily struggle is not laziness—it is science. Schools must start later to protect the health and success of their students.

The evidence is overwhelming. Research from sleep scientists shows that teenage brains are wired differently from adult brains. During adolescence, our internal body clocks shift forward by up to two hours. This means that asking a thirteen-year-old to fall asleep at nine o'clock is like asking an adult to sleep at seven o'clock. It simply does not work. Yet schools continue to ring the bell at eight-thirty or even earlier, forcing students to wake up when their bodies are still producing sleep hormones.

What are the consequences of this mismatch? Students arrive at school exhausted, unable to concentrate or learn effectively. Studies across the United Kingdom, United States and Australia reveal that sleep-deprived teenagers perform significantly worse in mathematics and reading. Their grades drop, their creativity suffers, and their memory weakens. Is this really the best we can offer our young people?

The health impacts are even more alarming. Chronic sleep loss in teenagers increases rates of depression, anxiety and obesity. It weakens immune systems, making students sick more often. Tired teenagers are also involved in more car accidents and injuries. These are not minor inconveniences—they are serious threats to wellbeing.

Some critics argue that later start times would disrupt family schedules or sporting activities. However, dozens of schools that have made the change report positive results across the board. In Seattle, when high schools shifted their start time from seven-fifty to eight-forty-five, students gained an average of thirty-four minutes of sleep per night. Attendance improved, grades rose, and tardiness decreased. Teachers reported more alert, engaged students. The benefits clearly outweigh the temporary adjustment challenges.

Others claim that teenagers should simply go to bed earlier. This argument ignores biological reality. We cannot command our bodies to sleep any more than we can command ourselves to grow taller. Teenagers are not choosing to stay awake—their brains are following a natural developmental pattern.

Every student deserves the opportunity to learn at their best. We provide nutritious meals, safe buildings and qualified teachers. Why would we not also provide appropriate schedules that match how young bodies actually work? The research is clear, the solutions are proven, and the stakes are high. It is time for schools to put student health first and move their clocks forward. Our teenagers are worth it.

Why does the writer compare falling asleep to growing taller?
A) To show that both processes happen during adolescence
B) To explain that sleep patterns cannot be controlled by willpower alone
C) To prove that teenagers need more sleep than adults
D) To suggest that sleep is important for physical growth

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) To show that both processes happen during adolescence
2. [ ] B) To explain that sleep patterns cannot be controlled by willpower alone
3. [ ] C) To prove that teenagers need more sleep than adults
4. [ ] D) To suggest that sleep is important for physical growth

**Solution:**
> • The passage states 'We cannot command our bodies to sleep any more than we can command ourselves to grow taller'
• This comparison is made in response to critics who say teenagers should simply go to bed earlier
• The writer uses growing taller as an example of something we cannot control through choice or willpower
• Therefore, the answer is B because the comparison illustrates that sleep timing, like height, is governed by biological processes beyond voluntary control

Passage:
The Colour of Courage
Amara pressed her nose against the cold window of the train, watching the English countryside blur into shades of green and grey. Three months ago, she had been in Lagos, surrounded by the bright colours and warm voices of home. Now, she was heading to Millbrook Grammar School, where she would be the only Nigerian girl in Year Seven.

"You'll do brilliantly," her mother had said at the station that morning, straightening Amara's new uniform. But her mother's eyes had looked worried, and that worry now sat heavy in Amara's stomach.

The school hall buzzed with excited chatter as students reunited after the summer holidays. Amara stood near the door, clutching her timetable. Groups of girls laughed together, their ponytails swinging as they hugged. Nobody looked her way.

"Lost?" A voice startled her. A red-haired girl with freckles smiled kindly. "I'm Sophie. You're new, right?"

Amara nodded, relief flooding through her. "I'm Amara. I just moved from Nigeria."

"Brilliant! Come sit with us at lunch."

But at lunch, everything changed. Sophie's friends, Maya and Charlotte, whispered to each other when Amara approached. Maya wrinkled her nose at Amara's lunch box.

"What is that smell?" Maya said loudly. "It's like... weird spices or something."

Amara looked down at her jollof rice, her grandmother's recipe. The tomatoes and peppers gleamed red in the fluorescent light. Back home, everyone loved this dish. Here, it suddenly felt wrong.

"It's just rice," Amara mumbled, closing the lid.

"Why can't you eat normal food?" Charlotte added, giggling.

Sophie said nothing, but she didn't meet Amara's eyes either.

For two weeks, Amara brought plain sandwiches to school. She spoke less in class, even though she knew the answers. She tried to make herself smaller, quieter, less different.

Then came the International Day assembly. Each student could share something from their culture. Amara planned to skip it, but her English teacher, Mrs. Patterson, had other ideas.

"You have stories worth telling, Amara," Mrs. Patterson said gently. "Don't hide your light."

On the morning of the assembly, Amara's hands shook as she walked to the front. She had brought her grandmother's wrapper cloth, patterned with bold oranges and blues. She had also brought jollof rice for everyone to taste.

"In Nigeria, we say that food is love made visible," Amara began, her voice barely above a whisper. Then she remembered her grandmother's laugh, her mother's proud face at the station, and Mrs. Patterson's words. She lifted her chin and spoke louder. "This dish is called jollof rice. Every family has their own special way of making it. This is my grandmother's recipe, and she taught my mother, who taught me."

She talked about Lagos, about her grandmother's kitchen filled with laughter, about the colours and music of home. As she spoke, something shifted. Students leaned forward, listening. When she offered samples of the rice, hands shot up eagerly.

"This is amazing!" someone called out.

After the assembly, Maya approached hesitantly. "I'm sorry about what I said before. That was really mean. Your lunch looked different, and I... I didn't understand. But different isn't bad."

Amara considered the apology. Maya looked genuinely sorry, her cheeks pink with embarrassment.

"Thank you," Amara said finally. "Maybe next time, you could ask about things instead of judging them."

Maya nodded seriously. "I will. I promise."

That afternoon, Amara opened her lunch box without hesitation. The jollof rice smelled like home, like love, like courage. And this time, when others looked her way, she smiled back.

Why did Amara bring plain sandwiches to school for two weeks?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) She wanted to try different English foods
2. [ ] B) She felt ashamed after her food was criticized
3. [ ] C) Her grandmother's recipe was too difficult to make
4. [ ] D) The school did not allow students to bring rice
5. [ ] E) She preferred sandwiches to jollof rice

**Solution:**
> • The passage shows that Maya and Charlotte criticized Amara's jollof rice, saying it smelled weird and asking why she couldn't eat 'normal food'
• After this incident, the passage states 'For two weeks, Amara brought plain sandwiches to school. She spoke less in class, even though she knew the answers. She tried to make herself smaller, quieter, less different.'
• This behavior indicates Amara was trying to fit in and avoid further criticism by hiding her cultural differences
• Therefore, the answer is B because Amara felt ashamed after her food was criticized and wanted to avoid being different

• Immediately after this incident, the passage states: 'For two weeks, Amara brought plain sandwiches to school. She spoke less in class, even though she knew the answers. She tried to make herself smaller, quieter, less different.'
• This sequence indicates that Amara changed her behavior because she felt embarrassed and wanted to fit in after her food was judged negatively.
• Therefore, the answer is B because Amara's decision to bring plain sandwiches was a direct response to feeling embarrassed when her cultural food was criticized by Maya and Charlotte.

Passage:
Why Our Cities Must Ban Single-Use Plastic Bags Now
Walk down any beach in the world and you will see them. Plastic bags tangled in seaweed. Plastic bags floating in the shallows. Plastic bags buried in the sand. These flimsy carriers, used for mere minutes, remain in our environment for centuries. It is time for every city to ban single-use plastic bags completely.

Some people argue that plastic bags are convenient and cheap. They claim that shoppers need them to carry groceries home. But this argument ignores a simple truth: we managed perfectly well before plastic bags existed. Our grandparents used cloth bags and baskets. They survived. We can too.

The environmental damage caused by plastic bags is staggering. Each year, Australians use approximately 3.6 billion plastic bags. Most end up in landfill or, worse, in our oceans. Marine animals mistake these bags for food. Sea turtles think they are jellyfish and eat them, often dying as a result. Birds feed plastic fragments to their chicks. Is our convenience worth the death of innocent creatures?

Critics say that banning plastic bags will hurt businesses and inconvenience customers. Yet cities that have already implemented bans prove otherwise. Rwanda banned plastic bags in 2008 and is now one of Africa's cleanest nations. Bangladesh banned them in 2002 after discovering they blocked drainage systems and caused flooding. In Australia, major supermarkets stopped providing single-use plastic bags in 2018. Customers adapted within weeks. Businesses thrived. Life continued.

The solution is remarkably simple. Reusable bags cost just a few dollars and last for years. They are stronger than plastic bags and can carry heavier loads. Many fold into tiny pouches that fit in pockets or handbags. Once you develop the habit of bringing your own bag, it becomes second nature. The minor inconvenience of remembering a bag is nothing compared to the environmental catastrophe we currently face.

Some argue we should focus on recycling instead of banning. However, recycling plastic bags is difficult and expensive. Most recycling facilities cannot process them. They jam machinery and contaminate other recyclables. Only a tiny percentage of plastic bags are actually recycled. The rest persist in our environment for up to 1,000 years.

We stand at a critical moment. Future generations will judge us by the choices we make today. Will we continue sacrificing our oceans and wildlife for a few minutes of convenience? Or will we show the courage to change our habits? The answer should be obvious. Every city, every town, every community must ban single-use plastic bags immediately. Our planet cannot wait any longer. The time for action is now.

What can be inferred about the author's view on people's ability to adapt to a plastic bag ban?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) People will find it too difficult to change their shopping habits
2. [ ] B) People can successfully adjust to using alternatives within a short time
3. [ ] C) People need government support to make the transition
4. [ ] D) People prefer plastic bags over all other options
5. [ ] E) People will stop shopping at supermarkets

**Solution:**
> • The passage states that when Australian supermarkets stopped providing plastic bags in 2018, 'Customers adapted within weeks'
• The author also mentions that 'Once you develop the habit of bringing your own bag, it becomes second nature'
• The author references how grandparents managed with cloth bags and baskets, showing people can adapt
• Therefore, the answer is B because the author clearly believes people can successfully adjust to alternatives in a short period of time

Passage:
Why Our Cities Must Ban Single-Use Plastic Bags Now
Walk down any beach in the world and you will see them. Plastic bags tangled in seaweed. Plastic bags floating in the shallows. Plastic bags buried in the sand.

Some critics argue that later start times would disrupt family schedules or sporting activities. However, dozens of schools that have made the change report positive results across the board. In Seattle, when high schools shifted their start time from seven-fifty to eight-forty-five, students gained an average of thirty-four minutes of sleep per night. Attendance improved, grades rose, and tardiness decreased. Teachers reported more alert, engaged students. The benefits clearly outweigh the temporary adjustment challenges.

Others claim that teenagers should simply go to bed earlier. This argument ignores biological reality. We cannot command our bodies to sleep any more than we can command ourselves to grow taller. Teenagers are not choosing to stay awake—their brains are following a natural developmental pattern.

Every student deserves the opportunity to learn at their best. We provide nutritious meals, safe buildings and qualified teachers. Why would we not also provide appropriate schedules that match how young bodies actually work? The research is clear, the solutions are proven, and the stakes are high. It is time for schools to put student health first and move their clocks forward. Our teenagers are worth it.

The passage contrasts teenage sleep patterns with adult sleep patterns by:
A) Showing that teenagers need more hours of total sleep than adults
B) Explaining that teenagers' body clocks shift forward by up to two hours
C) Proving that teenagers are lazier than adults in the morning
D) Demonstrating that adults do not produce sleep hormones

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) Showing that teenagers need more hours of total sleep than adults
2. [ ] B) Explaining that teenagers' body clocks shift forward by up to two hours
3. [ ] C) Proving that teenagers are lazier than adults in the morning
4. [ ] D) Demonstrating that adults do not produce sleep hormones

**Solution:**
> • The passage directly compares teenage and adult sleep patterns in the second paragraph
• It states: 'During adolescence, our internal body clocks shift forward by up to two hours'
• This is illustrated with the example that asking a thirteen-year-old to sleep at nine o'clock is like asking an adult to sleep at seven o'clock
• Therefore, the answer is B because the passage explicitly contrasts the two groups by explaining the two-hour forward shift in teenagers' body clocks

Passage:
The Colour of Courage
Amara pressed her nose against the cold window of the train, watching the English countryside blur into shades of green and grey. Three months ago, she had been in Lagos, surrounded by the bright colours and warm voices of home. Now, she was heading to Millbrook Grammar School, where she would be the only Nigerian girl in Year Seven.

"You'll do brilliantly," her mother had said at the station that morning, straightening Amara's new uniform. But her mother's eyes had looked worried, and that worry now sat heavy in Amara's stomach.

The school hall buzzed with excited chatter as students reunited after the summer holidays. Amara stood near the door, clutching her timetable. Groups of girls laughed together, their ponytails swinging as they hugged. Nobody looked her way.

"Lost?" A voice startled her. A red-haired girl with freckles smiled kindly. "I'm Sophie. You're new, right?"

Amara nodded, relief flooding through her. "I'm Amara. I just moved from Nigeria."

"Brilliant! Come sit with us at lunch."

But at lunch, everything changed. Sophie's friends, Maya and Charlotte, whispered to each other when Amara approached. Maya wrinkled her nose at Amara's lunch box.

"What is that smell?" Maya said loudly. "It's like... weird spices or something."

Amara looked down at her jollof rice, her grandmother's recipe. The tomatoes and peppers gleamed red in the fluorescent light. Back home, everyone loved this dish. Here, it suddenly felt wrong.

"It's just rice," Amara mumbled, closing the lid.

"Why can't you eat normal food?" Charlotte added, giggling.

Sophie said nothing, but she didn't meet Amara's eyes either.

For two weeks, Amara brought plain sandwiches to school. She spoke less in class, even though she knew the answers. She tried to make herself smaller, quieter, less different.

Then came the International Day assembly. Each student could share something from their culture. Amara planned to skip it, but her English teacher, Mrs. Patterson, had other ideas.

"You have stories worth telling, Amara," Mrs. Patterson said gently. "Don't hide your light."

On the morning of the assembly, Amara's hands shook as she walked to the front. She had brought her grandmother's wrapper cloth, patterned with bold oranges and blues. She had also brought jollof rice for everyone to taste.

"In Nigeria, we say that food is love made visible," Amara began, her voice barely above a whisper. Then she remembered her grandmother's laugh, her mother's proud face at the station, and Mrs. Patterson's words. She lifted her chin and spoke louder. "This dish is called jollof rice. Every family has their own special way of making it. This is my grandmother's recipe, and she taught my mother, who taught me."

She talked about Lagos, about her grandmother's kitchen filled with laughter, about the colours and music of home. As she spoke, something shifted. Students leaned forward, listening. When she offered samples of the rice, hands shot up eagerly.

"This is amazing!" someone called out.

After the assembly, Maya approached hesitantly. "I'm sorry about what I said before. That was really mean. Your lunch looked different, and I... I didn't understand. But different isn't bad."

Amara considered the apology. Maya looked genuinely sorry, her cheeks pink with embarrassment.

"Thank you," Amara said finally. "Maybe next time, you could ask about things instead of judging them."

Maya nodded seriously. "I will. I promise."

That afternoon, Amara opened her lunch box without hesitation. The jollof rice smelled like home, like love, like courage. And this time, when others looked her way, she smiled back.

How did Amara's behaviour change between the lunch incident and the International Day assembly?
A) She became more withdrawn and then more confident
B) She became more talkative and then more quiet
C) She became more angry and then more forgiving
D) She became more friendly and then more distant

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) She became more withdrawn and then more confident
2. [ ] B) She became more talkative and then more quiet
3. [ ] C) She became more angry and then more forgiving
4. [ ] D) She became more friendly and then more distant

**Solution:**
> • After the lunch incident, the passage states: 'For two weeks, Amara brought plain sandwiches to school. She spoke less in class, even though she knew the answers. She tried to make herself smaller, quieter, less different.' This shows she became more withdrawn.
• During the International Day assembly, Amara 'lifted her chin and spoke louder' and shared her culture confidently, with students responding positively. This shows she became more confident.
• Therefore, the answer is A because the passage explicitly describes Amara's transformation from withdrawn behaviour (speaking less, making herself smaller) to confident behaviour (speaking louder, sharing her culture openly).

**Question:**

Passage:
The Ancient Incan Road System: Connecting an Empire
High in the mountains of South America, an incredible network of roads once connected a vast empire. The Inca civilisation built over 40,000 kilometres of roads across some of the world's most challenging terrain. This remarkable achievement linked their empire from modern-day Colombia to Chile, crossing deserts, mountains, and rainforests.

The Incan road system, called Qhapaq Ñan, was constructed without the use of wheels or iron tools. Workers used stone hammers and bronze chisels to carve paths through solid rock. In flat areas, roads were up to 15 metres wide. In mountainous regions, they became narrow stone staircases climbing steep slopes. Some sections even included rope bridges that swung across deep valleys.

These roads served many important purposes for the empire. Messengers called chasquis ran along the routes, carrying news and information between cities. They could travel up to 240 kilometres in a single day by passing messages to the next runner at relay stations. The roads also allowed armies to move quickly across the empire, helping the Inca maintain control over distant regions. Additionally, traders used the routes to transport goods like food, textiles, and precious metals.

The Inca built their roads with careful planning and impressive engineering skills. In swampy areas, workers created raised causeways to keep the road surface dry. Through deserts, they placed marker posts to guide travellers when sand covered the path. In the mountains, they constructed drainage systems to prevent rainwater from washing away the roads. Stone retaining walls supported roads built on steep hillsides.

Rest houses called tambos were positioned every 20 to 30 kilometres along major routes. These buildings provided shelter, food, and supplies for official travellers. Storage facilities at tambos held emergency food reserves for times of famine. Some tambos were simple structures, whilst others were elaborate complexes with multiple buildings.

The road system reflected the Inca's strong central government and organised society. Only people on official business received permission to use the main roads. Common citizens needed special approval to travel. This control helped the empire manage resources and maintain security.

Today, sections of the ancient Incan roads still exist. Some routes remain in use by local communities in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. In 2014, UNESCO recognised Qhapaq Ñan as a World Heritage Site, acknowledging its historical importance. Archaeologists continue to study these roads to understand how the Inca built and maintained such an extensive network without modern technology. The roads stand as a testament to the ingenuity and determination of this ancient civilisation.

The Incan messengers were called:
A) tambos
B) chasquis
C) Qhapaq Ñan
D) causeways

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) tambos
2. [ ] B) chasquis
3. [ ] C) Qhapaq Ñan
4. [ ] D) causeways

**Solution:**
> • The passage states: 'Messengers called chasquis ran along the routes, carrying news and information between cities.'
• This directly identifies the name given to Incan messengers.
• Therefore, the answer is B because the passage explicitly states that messengers were called chasquis.

**Question:**
> Read the passage and answer the question.

The passage states that the Incan road system was a 'remarkable achievement'. In this context, the word 'remarkable' most closely means:

A) ordinary
B) extraordinary
C) difficult
D) ancient
E) useful

**Solution:**
> • The passage describes the Incan road system as covering 40,000 kilometres across challenging terrain including deserts, mountains, and rainforests.
• It was built without wheels or iron tools, which shows it was an impressive accomplishment.
• 'Remarkable' means worthy of attention or extraordinary, not ordinary (the opposite), and while the roads were difficult to build, ancient, and useful, these words don't capture the meaning of 'remarkable' in this context.
• Therefore, the answer is B because 'extraordinary' best matches the meaning of 'remarkable' as something impressive and worthy of notice.

**Issues:**
- ❌ Question has correct_answer but no answer_options array - possible mislabeling as extended_response

Passage: Why Every School Needs a Vegetable Garden

Walk into any school cafeteria today and you'll see something alarming: bins overflowing with uneaten vegetables whilst students line up for chips and sugary snacks. Is it any wonder that childhood obesity rates have tripled in the past thirty years? The solution is simpler than you might think, and it's growing right beneath our feet.

Every school in Australia should be required to maintain a vegetable garden where students grow, harvest and eat their own produce. This isn't just about healthy eating—it's about transforming how young people understand food, nature and responsibility.

Consider the evidence. Schools with vegetable gardens report that students eat 40% more vegetables than their peers. Why? Because children who grow tomatoes, carrots and lettuce develop a genuine connection to these foods. They've watched seeds sprout, pulled weeds in the hot sun, and felt the satisfaction of harvesting something they've nurtured. These vegetables aren't mysterious items from a supermarket shelf—they're the result of their own hard work.

But the benefits extend far beyond nutrition. School gardens are outdoor classrooms where mathematics, science and environmental studies come alive. Students measure garden beds, calculate growing seasons, observe insects and decomposition, and understand ecosystems firsthand. They learn that food doesn't magically appear in shops; it requires soil, water, time and care. This knowledge is disappearing from our society, and we're paying the price.

Critics argue that schools lack the space, time and money for gardens. These objections crumble under scrutiny. Even small courtyards can accommodate raised beds or vertical gardens. Garden maintenance requires just thirty minutes weekly, easily incorporated into existing science or health lessons. As for cost, initial setup expenses are minimal—soil, seeds and basic tools—whilst ongoing costs are virtually zero. Compare this to expensive sports equipment that schools replace annually.

Some educators worry about curriculum pressure, claiming there's no time for gardening when students must prepare for tests. This thinking is precisely backwards. Gardens don't distract from learning; they enhance it. Students retain information better when they're engaged in hands-on activities. A child who's planted beans understands plant biology far better than one who's merely read about it.

The question isn't whether we can afford school gardens. It's whether we can afford not to have them. With childhood diabetes rates soaring and environmental awareness more critical than ever, school gardens offer a practical, affordable solution. They teach students to value fresh food, understand where it comes from, and develop skills they'll use for life.

Isn't it time we gave every child the chance to get their hands dirty and discover that vegetables can actually be exciting? The evidence is clear, the benefits are numerous, and the cost is negligible. School gardens aren't a luxury—they're a necessity for the health and education of our children.

What can be inferred about why students currently waste vegetables in school cafeterias?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) The vegetables are not fresh enough
2. [ ] B) Students lack a personal connection to the vegetables they are served
3. [ ] C) School cafeterias serve too many vegetables
4. [ ] D) Students prefer chips because they are cheaper
5. [ ] E) The vegetables are not properly cooked

**Solution:**
> • The passage states that children who grow vegetables develop a genuine connection to these foods and that these vegetables aren't mysterious items from a supermarket shelf
• It contrasts this with the current situation where bins overflow with uneaten vegetables
• The implication is that students currently waste vegetables because they lack the personal connection that comes from growing them
• Therefore, the answer is B because students don't have a relationship with vegetables they haven't grown themselves, making them less likely to eat them

Why do students in schools with vegetable gardens eat more vegetables than other students?
A) Because vegetables from gardens taste better than store-bought ones
B) Because they feel personally connected to the food they have grown
C) Because their teachers force them to eat what they grow
D) Because garden vegetables are healthier than supermarket vegetables

• It explains that children who grow vegetables 'develop a genuine connection to these foods' because they've watched them grow and felt satisfaction from nurturing them
• The passage emphasizes that the vegetables are 'the result of their own hard work' rather than mysterious supermarket items

> Read the passage and answer the question.

According to the passage, the key difference between vegetables that children grow themselves and vegetables from supermarket shelves is:
A) Their nutritional value
B) Their taste and flavor
C) Children's connection and relationship to them
D) Their cost and affordability

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) Their nutritional value
2. [ ] B) Their taste and flavor
3. [ ] C) Children's connection and relationship to them
4. [ ] D) Their cost and affordability

**Solution:**
> • The passage states that children who grow vegetables 'develop a genuine connection to these foods'
• It explicitly contrasts homegrown vegetables ('the result of their own hard work') with supermarket vegetables ('mysterious items from a supermarket shelf')
• The passage emphasizes the relationship aspect: students have 'watched seeds sprout, pulled weeds in the hot sun, and felt the satisfaction of harvesting something they've nurtured'
• Therefore, the answer is C because the passage focuses on the connection children develop through growing their own vegetables, rather than nutritional differences, taste, or cost

**Question:**
> Read the passage and answer the question.

How does Maya's father's understanding of courage differ from Maya's initial understanding?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) Her father sees courage as exploring the world, while Maya sees it as staying home
2. [ ] B) Her father sees courage as serving others through duty, while Maya initially sees it as leaving for adventure
3. [ ] C) Her father sees courage as facing storms, while Maya sees it as opening exam results
4. [ ] D) Her father sees courage as family tradition, while Maya sees it as breaking traditions
5. [ ] E) Her father sees courage as polishing lenses, while Maya sees it as climbing stairs

**Solution:**
> • Maya's father explains that 'keeping this light burning isn't about being trapped. It's about being the person others can count on when everything else is dark and dangerous. That takes courage.'
• Maya initially wanted to leave the island ('I want to see the world!') and saw staying as being trapped, implying she viewed courage as the bravery to leave and explore.
• By the end, Maya realizes there is 'not just the courage to leave, but the courage to stay, to serve, to be someone's light in the storm.'
• Therefore, the answer is B because her father views courage as the duty of serving and being reliable for others, while Maya initially saw courage as having the bravery to leave for adventure and new experiences.

**Question:**
> Read the passage and answer the question.

What can be inferred about how Maya's feelings toward the lighthouse changed?
A) She realized it was more dangerous than she had thought
B) She began to see it as meaningful rather than just confining
C) She decided she preferred island life to mainland schools
D) She understood her father's job was too difficult for her

**Solution:**

• She then promises to return and says 'This will always be home,' showing she now values it
• She understands that growing up means 'finding a way to honour both' her old life and new life

**Question:**

Title: The Old Market Square

The cobblestones remember every footstep,
Worn smooth by centuries of hurried feet.
Vendors call out like songbirds at dawn,
Their voices weaving through the morning heat.

Beneath striped awnings, colours collide—
Crimson tomatoes, golden loaves of bread,
Silver fish gleaming on beds of ice,
Purple plums piled high like treasure spread.

The butcher's knife goes chop-chop-chop,
Rhythm steady as a beating drum.
Children dart between the crowded stalls,
Their laughter bright as they skip and run.

An old woman sits beside her flowers,
Her hands like branches, gnarled and brown.
She ties each bouquet with patient care,
A queen of petals in this bustling town.

The fountain whispers secrets to the square,
Its water dancing in the midday sun.
Generations meet here, young and old,
Where countless stories merge into one.

As shadows lengthen, the market sighs,
The vendors pack their wares away.
But tomorrow the square will wake again,
Ready to greet another vibrant day.

What does the old woman do in the market?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) She sells fish on beds of ice
2. [ ] B) She ties bouquets with patient care
3. [ ] C) She calls out like a songbird
4. [ ] D) She dances by the fountain
5. [ ] E) She sells loaves of bread

**Question:**
> Read the poem 'The Old Market Square' and answer the question.

[Full poem text as provided]

What poetic device is used in the line 'Vendors call out like songbirds at dawn'?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) Metaphor
2. [ ] B) Simile
3. [ ] C) Personification
4. [ ] D) Alliteration
5. [ ] E) Rhyme

**Solution:**
> • The line 'Vendors call out like songbirds at dawn' compares the vendors' voices to songbirds using the word 'like'
• A simile is a comparison between two things using 'like' or 'as'
• A metaphor would make a direct comparison without 'like' or 'as', and personification gives human qualities to non-human things
• Therefore, the answer is B because the line uses 'like' to create a comparison, which is the defining feature of a simile

**Question:**
> Read the passage and answer the question.

The passage suggests that without effective communication, a bee colony would fail because:

A) Individual bees would not know how to perform the waggle dance
B) The thousands of bees could not coordinate their activities and work together
C) Queen bees would be unable to produce the necessary pheromones
D) Flowers would be too far away for bees to find on their own
E) Scientists would not be able to study bee behavior

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) Individual bees would not know how to perform the waggle dance
2. [ ] B) The thousands of bees could not coordinate their activities and work together
3. [ ] C) Queen bees would be unable to produce the necessary pheromones
4. [ ] D) Flowers would be too far away for bees to find on their own
5. [ ] E) Scientists would not be able to study bee behavior

**Solution:**
> • The passage states: 'Without clear communication, this complex society would collapse. The waggle dance and pheromone signals allow bees to coordinate their activities and make decisions as a group.'

• Therefore, the answer is B because the main idea is that communication enables the large colony to coordinate and work together, and without it, they could not function as an organized society

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) 5
2. [ ] B) 7
3. [ ] C) 8
4. [ ] D) 9
5. [ ] E) 11

**Solution:**
> • Let P = pottery shard value and A = arrowhead value
• First equation: 5P + 3A = 41

2. [ ] B) 22 points
3. [ ] C) 24 points
4. [ ] D) 26 points
5. [ ] E) 28 points

**Solution:**
> • Let G = value of one gem and C = value of one coin
• From the given information: 4G + C = 23 and 2G + 3C = 21
• From the first equation: C = 23 - 4G
• Substitute into the second equation: 2G + 3(23 - 4G) = 21
• Simplify: 2G + 69 - 12G = 21, so -10G = -48, thus G = 4.8
• Substitute back: C = 23 - 4(4.8) = 23 - 19.2 = 3.8
• Calculate 3G + 2C = 3(4.8) + 2(3.8) = 14.4 + 7.6 = 22
• Check: 4(4.8) + 3.8 = 19.2 + 3.8 = 23 ✓ and 2(4.8) + 3(3.8) = 9.6 + 11.4 = 21 ✓

• Multiply first equation by 3: 9T + 6S = 57. Multiply second equation by 2: 4T + 6S = 42
• Subtract the second from the first: (9T + 6S) - (4T + 6S) = 57 - 42, which gives 5T = 15, so T = 3
• Substitute T = 3 into first equation: 3(3) + 2S = 19, so 9 + 2S = 19, thus 2S = 10 and S = 5
• Check with second equation: 2(3) + 3(5) = 6 + 15 = 21 ✓
• Maya has 5 tokens and 4 stickers: 5T + 4S = 5(3) + 4(5) = 15 + 28 = 43 points

**Question:**
> A designer creates a logo using a rectangle and removes a square section from one corner. The original rectangle measures 36 cm by 20 cm. The square removed has a side length of 8 cm. What is the perimeter of the final logo shape?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) 104 cm
2. [ ] B) 112 cm
3. [ ] C) 120 cm
4. [ ] D) 128 cm
5. [ ] E) 136 cm

**Solution:**
> • Original rectangle perimeter would be 2(36 + 20) = 112 cm, but we need the perimeter of the shape after removing the corner square
• When we remove an 8 cm × 8 cm square from a corner, we remove two sides of the square (each 8 cm) from the original perimeter
• However, we add two new sides (each 8 cm) where the square was cut out, creating an indented corner
• Net effect: we remove 2 sides of 8 cm and add 2 sides of 8 cm, so the perimeter stays the same
• Therefore, the answer is B because the perimeter remains 112 cm

**Question:**
> A solid wooden cube with edge length 6 cm is painted red on all six faces. It is then cut into smaller cubes, each with edge length 2 cm.

How many of the small cubes will have paint on exactly two faces?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) 8
2. [ ] B) 12
3. [ ] C) 24
4. [ ] D) 27
5. [ ] E) 36

**Solution:**
> • The large cube (6 cm edge) is divided into smaller cubes (2 cm edge): 6 ÷ 2 = 3 cubes along each edge
• Total small cubes = 3 × 3 × 3 = 27 cubes
• Cubes with paint on exactly 2 faces are located along the edges of the large cube, but NOT at corners
• The large cube has 12 edges. Along each edge there are 3 small cubes, but the 2 corner cubes have 3 painted faces
• So each edge contributes 3 - 2 = 1 cube with exactly 2 painted faces
• Total cubes with exactly 2 painted faces = 12 × 1 = 12
• Therefore, the answer is B because there are 12 small cubes positioned along the edges (but not at corners) of the original cube

• Total surface area = 2(lw + lh + wh) = 2(2×2 + 2×5 + 2×5) = 2(4 + 10 + 10) = 2(24) = 48 m²
• The bottom face (which won't be painted) has area = 2 × 2 = 4 m²
• Surface area to be painted = 48 - 4 = 44 m²
• Therefore, the answer is C because 44 m² of surface area needs to be painted

**ID:** `df747ba2-d0ee-41ea-bb4d-88fe5ab077f8`

**Question:**
> A wildlife researcher tracks a bird's nest at position N(−7, 2) on a forest grid. The position is reflected across the y-axis to mark a symmetrical observation point. What are the coordinates of the new observation point?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) (7, −2)
2. [ ] B) (7, 2)
3. [ ] C) (−7, −2)
4. [ ] D) (−7, 2)
5. [ ] E) (2, −7)

**Solution:**
> • When reflecting across the y-axis, the y-coordinate stays the same and the x-coordinate changes to its opposite
• The original position is N(−7, 2)
• Reflecting across the y-axis: x-coordinate changes from −7 to 7, y-coordinate stays 2
• Therefore, the answer is B because the new coordinates are (7, 2)

**Question:**
> A pilot marks a checkpoint at position C(4, −6) on a flight grid. The checkpoint is first rotated 180° around the origin, then the result is reflected across the x-axis.

What are the final coordinates of the checkpoint?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) (−4, −6)
2. [ ] B) (−4, 6)
3. [ ] C) (4, 6)
4. [ ] D) (4, −6)
5. [ ] E) (−6, 4)

**Solution:**
> • Step 1: Rotate C(4, −6) by 180° around the origin. A 180° rotation changes (x, y) to (−x, −y), so (4, −6) becomes (−4, 6).
• Step 2: Reflect (−4, 6) across the x-axis. Reflection across the x-axis keeps the x-coordinate the same and negates the y-coordinate, so (−4, 6) becomes (−4, −6).
• Therefore, the answer is A because after both transformations, the checkpoint is at (−4, −6).

**Question:**
> A glass aquarium is shaped like a rectangular prism with dimensions 50 cm × 30 cm × 40 cm. The aquarium is filled with water to 60% of its capacity. A decorative rock with a volume of 6000 cm³ is then placed into the aquarium, causing the water level to rise.

What is the new percentage of the aquarium's capacity that is filled with water after the rock is added?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) 66%
2. [ ] B) 70%
3. [ ] C) 72%
4. [ ] D) 75%
5. [ ] E) 78%

**Solution:**
> • Total volume of aquarium = 50 × 30 × 40 = 60,000 cm³
• Initial water volume = 60% of 60,000 = 0.60 × 60,000 = 36,000 cm³
• Volume of rock = 6,000 cm³
• When the rock is submerged, it displaces water, raising the level. The combined volume of water and rock = 36,000 + 6,000 = 42,000 cm³
• New percentage filled = (42,000 ÷ 60,000) × 100% = 0.70 × 100% = 70%
• Therefore, the answer is B because the water and rock together occupy 70% of the aquarium's total capacity

What is the minimum area of foil needed to wrap one candle?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) 480 cm²
2. [ ] B) 392 cm²
3. [ ] C) 196 cm²
4. [ ] D) 272 cm²
5. [ ] E) 240 cm²

**Solution:**
> • To wrap the candle completely, we need to find the total surface area of the rectangular prism
• Surface area formula: 2(lw + lh + wh) where l=8, w=5, h=12
• Calculate each face pair: Top/Bottom = 2(8×5) = 80 cm², Front/Back = 2(8×12) = 192 cm², Left/Right = 2(5×12) = 120 cm²
• Total surface area = 80 + 192 + 120 = 392 cm²
• Therefore, the answer is B because 392 cm² of foil is needed to completely wrap one candle

#### Question 1 ✅ (PASS)

**ID:** `885270d1-8329-4969-b0a3-381fda9c81a3`

**Question:**
> A rectangular piece of paper measuring 24 cm by 18 cm has four identical squares cut from its corners. If each square has a side length of 3 cm, what is the perimeter of the remaining shape?

**Options:**
1. [ ] A) 84 cm
2. [ ] B) 108 cm
3. [ ] C) 96 cm
4. [ ] D) 102 cm
5. [ ] E) 90 cm

**Solution:**
> • Original rectangle has perimeter = 2(24 + 18) = 84 cm, but this changes when corners are cut
• When a square is cut from a corner, we remove 2 sides of length 3 cm from the perimeter, but add 2 new sides of length 3 cm
• Each corner cut removes sides totaling 6 cm and adds sides totaling 6 cm, creating an indentation
• The new perimeter = original perimeter + (additional perimeter from cuts) = 84 + 4(2 × 3) = 84 + 24 = 108 cm
• Alternatively: count all outer edges: top has 24 - 3 - 3 + 3 + 3 = 24 cm, similarly for all sides, plus the 8 new edges of 3 cm each = 24 + 24 + 18 + 18 + 24 = 108 cm
• Therefore, the answer is B because cutting corners adds extra edges that increase the total perimeter to 108 cm

2. [ ] B) 1200
3. [ ] C) 800
4. [ ] D) 960
5. [ ] E) 600

**Solution:**
> • Let the width be w metres, then the length is 3w metres
• Perimeter = 2(length + width) = 2(3w + w) = 2(4w) = 8w
• Since perimeter = 160 metres: 8w = 160, so w = 20 metres
• Length = 3w = 3 × 20 = 60 metres
• Area = length × width = 60 × 20 = 1200 square metres
• Therefore, the answer is B because the area of the rectangular field is 1200 square metres

**Solution:**
> • Each term is the sum of all previous terms: 1, 1+1=2, 1+1+2=4, 1+1+2+4=8 (wait, checking pattern differently)
• Actually: 1, 2 (1+1), 4 (1+2+1), 7 (2+4+1), 13 (4+7+2), 24 (7+13+4)
• Pattern: each term = sum of previous two terms plus the term before that, minus a correction. Let me verify: 1→2 (+1), 2→4 (+2), 4→7 (+3), 7→13 (+6), 13→24 (+11)
• Differences: 1, 2, 3, 6, 11... Next difference pattern: 1, 2, 3 (1+2), 6 (2+3+1), 11 (3+6+2)
• Each difference is the sum of the previous two differences: 1+2=3, 2+3=5 (no), trying again: differences are 1, 2, 3, 6, 11
• The pattern in differences: 1, 2, 3, 6 (2+3+1), 11 (3+6+2), next is 6+11+3=20
• Actually simpler: each term equals sum of previous two terms plus term three positions back: 7+13+4=24, so 13+24+7=44
• Therefore, the answer is B because 24+20=44
