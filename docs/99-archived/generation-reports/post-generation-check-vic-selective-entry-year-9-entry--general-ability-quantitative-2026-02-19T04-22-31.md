## ⚠️  Failures Requiring Attention

The following sub-skills had questions that failed all 3 generation attempts:

- **Number Series & Sequences**: 13 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic
- **Number Grids & Matrices**: 5 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic
- **Applied Word Problems**: 22 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic
- **Pattern Recognition in Paired Numbers**: 21 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic

**Action required:** Re-run the generation script — gap detection will automatically retry these.

## Next Steps

1. **Re-run generation** — 61 questions still needed:
   ```
   npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/generation/generate-section-all-modes.ts \
     --test="VIC Selective Entry (Year 9 Entry)" \
     --section="General Ability - Quantitative" \
     --modes="practice_1,practice_2,practice_3,practice_4,practice_5,diagnostic"
   ```

2. Generate drills once complete:
   ```
   npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/generation/generate-drills-for-section.ts \
     --test="VIC Selective Entry (Year 9 Entry)" \
     --section="General Ability - Quantitative" \
     --drills-per-subskill=20
   ```
