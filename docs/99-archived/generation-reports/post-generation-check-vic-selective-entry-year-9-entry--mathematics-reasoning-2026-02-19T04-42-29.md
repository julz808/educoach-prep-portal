- **Fractions, Decimals & Percentages**: 15 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic
- **Geometry - Area, Perimeter & Volume**: 9 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic
- **Ratios & Proportions**: 8 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic
- **Data Interpretation - Tables & Graphs**: 8 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic
- **Number Operations & Properties**: 8 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic

## Next Steps

1. **Re-run generation** — 78 questions still needed:
   ```
   npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/generation/generate-section-all-modes.ts \
     --test="VIC Selective Entry (Year 9 Entry)" \
     --section="Mathematics Reasoning" \
     --modes="practice_1,practice_2,practice_3,practice_4,practice_5,diagnostic"
   ```

2. Generate drills once complete:
   ```
   npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/generation/generate-drills-for-section.ts \
     --test="VIC Selective Entry (Year 9 Entry)" \
     --section="Mathematics Reasoning" \
     --drills-per-subskill=20
   ```
