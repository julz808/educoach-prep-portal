## Next Steps

1. **Re-run generation** — 34 questions still needed:
   ```
   npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/generation/generate-section-all-modes.ts \
     --test="Year 7 NAPLAN" \
     --section="Language Conventions" \
     --modes="practice_1,practice_2,practice_3,practice_4,practice_5,diagnostic"
   ```

2. Generate drills once complete:
   ```
   npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/generation/generate-drills-for-section.ts \
     --test="Year 7 NAPLAN" \
     --section="Language Conventions" \
     --drills-per-subskill=20
   ```
