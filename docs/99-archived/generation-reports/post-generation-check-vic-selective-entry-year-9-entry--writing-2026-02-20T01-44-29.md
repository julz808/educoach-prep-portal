## ⚠️  Failures Requiring Attention

The following sub-skills had questions that failed all 3 generation attempts:

- **Creative Writing**: 2 failed across modes: practice_3, practice_4, practice_5

**Action required:** Re-run the generation script — gap detection will automatically retry these.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Re-run generation** — 2 questions still needed:
   ```
   npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/generation/generate-section-all-modes.ts \
     --test="VIC Selective Entry (Year 9 Entry)" \
     --section="Writing" \
     --modes="practice_3,practice_4,practice_5"
   ```

2. Generate drills once complete:
   ```
   npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/generation/generate-drills-for-section.ts \
     --test="VIC Selective Entry (Year 9 Entry)" \
     --section="Writing" \
     --drills-per-subskill=20
   ```
