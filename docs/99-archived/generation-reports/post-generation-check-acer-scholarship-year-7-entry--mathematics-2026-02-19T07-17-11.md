## ⚠️  Failures Requiring Attention

The following sub-skills had questions that failed all 3 generation attempts:

- **Set Theory & Venn Diagrams**: 30 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic
- **Probability**: 2 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic
- **Geometry - Perimeter & Area**: 1 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic
- **Spatial Reasoning - Reflections & Transformations**: 24 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic
- **Spatial Reasoning - 3D Visualization**: 24 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic
- **Fractions & Number Lines**: 3 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic
- **Logic Puzzles & Algebraic Reasoning**: 9 failed across modes: practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, diagnostic

**Action required:** Re-run the generation script — gap detection will automatically retry these.

## Next Steps

1. **Re-run generation** — 93 questions still needed:
   ```
   npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/generation/generate-section-all-modes.ts \
     --test="ACER Scholarship (Year 7 Entry)" \
     --section="Mathematics" \
     --modes="practice_1,practice_2,practice_3,practice_4,practice_5,diagnostic"
   ```

2. Generate drills once complete:
   ```
   npx tsx --env-file=.env scripts/generation/generate-drills-for-section.ts \
     --test="ACER Scholarship (Year 7 Entry)" \
     --section="Mathematics" \
     --drills-per-subskill=20
   ```
