# ðŸ“‹ Difficulty Level System Change

## **Change Summary**
**Date**: December 2024  
**Change**: Simplified difficulty level system from 5 levels to 3 levels

---

## **Previous System (5 Levels)**
- **Level 1**: Basic
- **Level 2**: Below Average  
- **Level 3**: Average
- **Level 4**: Above Average
- **Level 5**: Advanced

---

## **New System (3 Levels)**
- **Level 1**: Easy
- **Level 2**: Medium (average difficulty for the specific test type/year level)
- **Level 3**: Hard

---

## **Rationale**
1. **Simplified User Experience**: Clearer distinction between difficulty levels
2. **Curriculum Alignment**: Better matches how educational assessments typically categorize difficulty
3. **Implementation Efficiency**: Easier to manage and generate consistent content
4. **User Understanding**: More intuitive for students, parents, and educators

## Important Clarification
**CRITICAL**: The difficulty scale 1-3 is **relative within each test type**. Every test type and sub-skill combination supports all three difficulty levels:

- **1 = Accessible**: Easier questions within the specific test type's standards
- **2 = Standard**: Typical questions for the specific test type  
- **3 = Challenging**: Harder questions within the specific test type's standards

**Key Point**: A difficulty 2 for NAPLAN Year 5 is different from a difficulty 2 for ACER or NSW Selective. Each test type maintains its own internal difficulty progression from 1 (accessible within that test) to 3 (challenging within that test).

## Implementation Details
- All test types support difficulties 1-3
- Difficulty is relative to the specific test's cognitive demands and standards
- Question generation prompts clarify this relative scaling
- Database schema supports 1-3 difficulty range for all test types

## Files Updated

### Core System Files
- âœ… `src/data/curriculumData.ts`: Updated `getCurriculumDifficulty` function to support all difficulties 1-3 for all test types
- âœ… `src/services/questionGenerationService.ts`: Enhanced prompts with test-specific difficulty guidance and relative scaling clarification
- âœ… `src/services/apiService.ts`: Updated test mode types (removed practice_4, practice_5)
- âœ… `src/services/visualCacheService.ts`: Added difficulty level 3 support for all visual types
- âœ… `src/components/QuestionGenerationAdmin.tsx`: Updated UI to show `/3` instead of `/5`
- âœ… `src/components/QuestionInterface.tsx`: Updated difficulty indicator to show 3 dots instead of 5

### Documentation Files
- âœ… `PRD_EduCourse.md`: Added difficulty scale clarification section
- âœ… `PRD_EDUCOACH_PREP_PORTAL.md`: Added difficulty scale clarification section  
- âœ… `DIFFICULTY_LEVEL_CHANGE.md`: Updated with relative scaling explanation

### Key Changes Made
1. **Prompt Enhancement**: Added `getTestSpecificDifficultyGuidance()` function providing tailored difficulty descriptions for each test type
2. **Relative Scaling Clarification**: Updated all prompts to emphasize that difficulty is relative within each test type
3. **UI Updates**: Changed all difficulty displays from `/5` to `/3` scale
4. **Comprehensive Support**: Ensured all test generation functions (diagnostic, practice, drill) support all three difficulty levels for every test type
5. **Documentation**: Added clear explanations that difficulty is test-type relative, not absolute across test types

## Verification
- âœ… All test types can generate questions at difficulties 1, 2, and 3
- âœ… Difficulty guidance is test-specific (NAPLAN, ACER, EduTest, Selective)
- âœ… Database constraints support 1-3 range for all test types
- âœ… UI components display difficulty correctly
- âœ… Visual cache supports all difficulty levels
