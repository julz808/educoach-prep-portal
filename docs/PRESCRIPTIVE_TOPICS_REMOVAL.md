# Prescriptive Topics Removal - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to remove prescriptive Australian context topics from the EduCoach Prep Portal, enabling Claude 4 Sonnet to generate more flexible and diverse topics dynamically.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed ENGAGING_TOPICS_YEAR_6_9 Array
**File:** `src/services/questionGenerationService.ts`
- **Removed:** The hardcoded array of 50+ Australian-specific topics
- **Impact:** Eliminates prescriptive topic constraints for question generation
- **Benefit:** Allows Claude 4 Sonnet to generate contextually appropriate topics based on the specific test type and sub-skill

### 2. Updated getContextInstruction Function
**File:** `src/services/questionGenerationService.ts`
- **Modified:** Context instruction logic to remove dependency on prescriptive topic lists
- **Change:** Now relies on Claude's ability to generate appropriate topics dynamically
- **Result:** More flexible and adaptive topic generation

### 3. Removed Content Examples Section
**File:** `src/services/questionGenerationService.ts`
- **Removed:** "Content Examples for ${testType} Authenticity" section from prompt template
- **Eliminated:** Prescriptive examples like:
  - Real-world applications matching test standards
  - Age-appropriate scenarios with authentic complexity
  - Topics that reflect actual test question themes
  - Contexts familiar to Australian students
- **Benefit:** Allows Claude to generate more diverse and creative contexts

### 4. Removed AUSTRALIAN_CONTEXT_TOPICS Export
**File:** `src/data/curriculumData.ts`
- **Removed:** Entire `AUSTRALIAN_CONTEXT_TOPICS` data structure
- **Eliminated:** Categorized topic lists (informational, narrative, persuasive)
- **Impact:** Reduces codebase complexity and removes topic constraints

### 5. Cleaned Up Import Statements
**File:** `src/services/questionGenerationService.ts`
- **Removed:** `AUSTRALIAN_CONTEXT_TOPICS` import
- **Result:** Cleaner import structure without unused dependencies

## Benefits of These Changes

### 1. Enhanced Flexibility
- Claude 4 Sonnet can now generate topics that are:
  - More contextually relevant to specific sub-skills
  - Adapted to the difficulty level of the question
  - Aligned with current trends and student interests
  - Diverse across different cultural contexts

### 2. Reduced Maintenance Overhead
- No need to maintain and update prescriptive topic lists
- Eliminates the risk of topics becoming outdated or irrelevant
- Reduces code complexity and potential points of failure

### 3. Improved Question Quality
- Topics are generated dynamically based on:
  - Specific test type requirements
  - Sub-skill alignment needs
  - Appropriate difficulty level
  - Current educational standards

### 4. Better Scalability
- System can adapt to new test types without requiring topic list updates
- Supports international contexts beyond Australian-specific content
- Enables more personalized and engaging question content

## Technical Implementation Details

### Context Generation Approach
The system now uses a three-tier approach for context generation:
1. **Australian Context (15%):** For maintaining some local relevance
2. **Trending Topics (35%):** For current and engaging content
3. **Universal Context (50%):** For broadly applicable scenarios

### Dynamic Topic Generation
Claude 4 Sonnet now generates topics by:
- Analyzing the specific sub-skill requirements
- Considering the test type and difficulty level
- Creating contextually appropriate scenarios
- Ensuring alignment with educational standards

## Verification
All changes have been tested to ensure:
- ✅ Question generation continues to work correctly
- ✅ No broken imports or references remain
- ✅ Template strings are properly formatted
- ✅ Context generation is more flexible and dynamic

## Future Considerations
- Monitor question quality to ensure topics remain appropriate
- Consider implementing feedback mechanisms for topic relevance
- Evaluate the need for any minimal topic guidance if quality issues arise
- Track diversity and engagement metrics for generated content
