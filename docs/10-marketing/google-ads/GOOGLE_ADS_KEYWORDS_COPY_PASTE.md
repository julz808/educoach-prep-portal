# 🔄 WEEKLY OPTIMIZATION TASKS

## **Every Monday:**

1. **Review Search Terms Report**
   - Look for irrelevant searches
   - Add 5-10 new negative keywords per campaign

2. **Check Keyword Performance**
   - Pause keywords with 0 clicks after 50 impressions
   - Pause keywords with <1% CTR after 100 impressions

3. **Review Conversion Data**
   - Note which keywords are converting
   - Increase bids on converters by 20-30%

4. **Budget Adjustments**
   - Move budget from non-converters to converters
   - Scale winners, cut losers

---

# 📝 NOTES & TIPS

## **Why Exact + Phrase Only?**
- ✅ Maximum control over search queries
- ✅ Minimal wasted spend
- ✅ High-quality, high-intent traffic only
- ⚠️ Lower volume than broad match
- ⚠️ Slower data collection (2-3 months vs 4-6 weeks)

## **When to Add Broad Match:**
If after 30 days you're getting:
- Less than 50 clicks/week total
- Less than 2 conversions/week
- Less than 200 impressions/day

Then consider adding 3-5 broad match keywords per campaign.

## **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Don't change bidding strategy during first 2 weeks
- ❌ Don't pause keywords with low impressions (they might convert!)
- ❌ Don't forget to add new negative keywords weekly
- ❌ Don't make multiple changes at once

## **Success Indicators (Week 2):**
- ✅ 300+ impressions/day across all campaigns
- ✅ 15+ clicks/day across all campaigns
- ✅ 1-2 conversions/week minimum
- ✅ Search terms are all relevant (no "laptop" or "free" searches)

---

# 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

## **If Impressions Are Too Low (<100/day):**
1. Increase max CPC to $3.50
2. Add 5-10 more keyword variations
3. Check if campaigns are "Limited by budget"
4. Consider adding broad match for top performers

## **If CTR Is Low (<3%):**
1. Improve ad copy (add benefits, urgency)
2. Make sure ads link to specific product pages
3. Add negative keywords to filter out bad searches
4. Pause low-performing keywords

## **If No Conversions After 2 Weeks:**
1. Check if conversion tracking is working
2. Verify ads link to correct product pages (not homepage!)
3. Review landing page (is it compelling?)
4. Check if price ($199) is clear and visible
5. Consider reducing friction in checkout process
