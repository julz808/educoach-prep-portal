# 🔄 WEEKLY OPTIMIZATION TASKS

## **Every Monday (Weekly Review):**

### **1. Review Search Terms Report**
- Go to each campaign → Keywords → Search Terms
- Look for irrelevant searches that got clicks
- Add 5-10 new negative keywords per campaign

**Common bad searches to look for:**
- "free" anything
- "jobs" or "career"
- Wrong products (ACER laptop, etc.)
- Wrong year levels
- Wrong states

---

### **2. Check Keyword Performance**
- Pause keywords with:
  - 0 clicks after 100+ impressions
  - <1% CTR after 200+ impressions
  - 0 conversions after 100+ clicks

**Note:** Don't pause too early! Give keywords 2-3 weeks minimum.

---

### **3. Review Conversion Data**
- Which keywords are converting?
- What's the average CPA per campaign?
- Which campaigns are profitable?

**Action:**
- Increase budget on profitable campaigns by 20-30%
- Decrease or pause unprofitable campaigns

---

### **4. Monitor Budget Pacing**
- Are campaigns hitting daily budget limit?
- Running out of budget by noon? Increase budget or bid lower
- Not spending full budget? Increase max CPC or add keywords

---

## **Every Day (Quick Check - 5 minutes):**

- Check total conversions (should be 1-2/day)
- Verify no campaigns paused accidentally
- Look for any unusual spending spikes

---

# 📅 TRANSITION TO PHASE 2

## **When to Switch from Maximize Clicks → Maximize Conversions**

### **Requirements (Must Meet ALL):**

✅ **Minimum 20 conversions** in last 30 days across all campaigns
✅ **Stable conversion rate** (not wildly fluctuating day-to-day)
✅ **Clean negative keyword list** (minimal irrelevant search terms)
✅ **All ads linking to product pages** (not homepage)
✅ **4-6 weeks of data** collected

---

## **How to Transition (Week 5-6):**

### **Step 1: Analyze Phase 1 Performance**

**For each campaign, calculate:**
- Average CPA (Cost per Conversion)
- Conversion Rate
- Total conversions
- Total spend

**Example:**
```
ACER Campaign:
- Total spend: $600
- Total conversions: 15
- Average CPA: $40
- Conversion rate: 3.5%
```

---

### **Step 2: Switch to Maximize Conversions**

**For each campaign:**

1. Go to Settings → Bidding
2. Click "Change bid strategy"
3. Select **"Maximize conversions"**
4. **OPTIONAL:** Set target CPA
   - If current CPA is $40, set target to $35 (↓12%)
   - If current CPA is $150, set target to $120 (↓20%)
   - **OR leave blank** to let Google optimize freely
5. Click Save

**IMPORTANT:** Only change ONE campaign per day
- Monday: Switch VIC Selective
- Tuesday: Switch EduTest
- Wednesday: Switch ACER
- etc.

**Why?** Easier to monitor impact per campaign

---

### **Step 3: Monitor Learning Period (7-14 Days)**

**What to expect during learning:**
- ⚠️ Impressions may decrease 20-40% (normal)
- ⚠️ CPC may increase 10-30% (normal)
- ⚠️ Some days will have 0 conversions (normal)
- ✅ Overall CPA should decrease by Week 2

**DON'T PANIC if:**
- First 3 days have higher CPA
- Click volume drops
- Some campaigns pause showing ads temporarily

**DO PANIC if:**
- Zero impressions for 3+ days straight
- Zero conversions for 2+ weeks
- CPA increases 100%+ after 2 weeks

---

### **Step 4: Compare Performance**

**After 30 days on Maximize Conversions, compare:**

| Metric | Phase 1 (Clicks) | Phase 2 (Conversions) | Change |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|--------|
| Daily Clicks | 30 | 28 | ↓7% |
| Daily Conversions | 1.2 | 1.8 | ↑50% |
| Conversion Rate | 2.5% | 4.0% | ↑60% |
| CPA | $125 | $85 | ↓32% |
| ROAS | 1.6x | 2.3x | ↑44% |

**If improvements like above:** ✅ Success! Keep Maximize Conversions

**If performance worse:** ⚠️ Switch back to Maximize Clicks, troubleshoot

---

# 🚨 TROUBLESHOOTING

## **Issue 1: Low Impressions (<100/day total)**

**Possible causes:**
- Max CPC too low ($2.50 might be too low)
- Budget too low
- Keywords too specific
- Campaign "Limited by budget"

**Solutions:**
1. Increase max CPC to $3.50
2. Increase daily budget by 50%
3. Add 10 more broad match keywords
4. Check campaign status (not paused?)

---

## **Issue 2: High Impressions but Low Clicks (<2% CTR)**

**Possible causes:**
- Ads not compelling
- Landing page not relevant
- Search queries not relevant (need more negatives)

**Solutions:**
1. Improve ad copy (add benefits, urgency)
2. Verify ads link to correct product pages
3. Add 20-30 more negative keywords
4. Review search terms - what's showing?

---

## **Issue 3: Good Clicks but No Conversions**

**Possible causes:**
- Conversion tracking broken
- Landing page not converting
- Product page has issues
- Price too high ($199)
- Checkout process broken

**Solutions:**
1. Test conversion tracking (make test purchase)
2. Review product page (is CTA clear?)
3. Check checkout process (any errors?)
4. Look at search terms (are they high-intent?)
5. Consider A/B testing price ($179 vs $199)

---

## **Issue 4: Lots of Irrelevant Searches**

**Examples:**
- "acer laptop" clicks
- "free naplan test" clicks
- "selective school teacher jobs" clicks

**Solutions:**
1. Add those terms as negative keywords IMMEDIATELY
2. Check if negatives are set to "phrase match" (not broad)
3. Review and expand negative list weekly
4. Consider switching some keywords to phrase match

---

## **Issue 5: Campaign Spending Too Much**

**Example:** ACER spending $40/day instead of $20/day

**Causes:**
- Google can spend up to 2x daily budget on peak days
- Averages out over month
- High-performing campaign gets more spend

**Solutions:**
1. If okay with variation: Do nothing (normal behavior)
2. If need strict limit: Set shared budget
3. Reduce max CPC bid limit
4. Pause during peak hours (if identified)
