# 🚨 WHAT TO WATCH

## Red Flags - Group A (Maximize Conversions):

**VIC Selective or EduTest:**
- ⚠️ CPA above $150 after Week 2
- ⚠️ Zero conversions for 3+ days
- ⚠️ Spending $60-80/day with few conversions

**Action:** Switch back to Maximize Clicks temporarily

---

## Red Flags - Group B (Maximize Clicks):

**ACER or Others:**
- ⚠️ Zero conversions after 4 weeks
- ⚠️ Lots of irrelevant search terms
- ⚠️ CTR below 2%

**Action:** Pause campaign or reduce budget

---

# 💡 PRO TIPS

1. **Monitor Group A Closely First 3 Days**
   - Check 2-3 times per day
   - If spending too much with no conversions, add more negatives

2. **Don't Compare Group A to Group B**
   - They have different strategies
   - Group A will have higher CPC but lower CPA
   - Group B will have lower CPC but higher CPA initially

3. **Graduate Campaigns When Ready**
   - Don't rush ACER to Conversions before 15 conversions
   - Don't keep VIC on Clicks (it has data!)

4. **Reallocate Budget Monthly**
   - If Year 5 NAPLAN gets 0 conversions, pause it
   - Move that $3/day to VIC or EduTest
