# 🔄 WEEKLY OPTIMIZATION TASKS

## Every Monday (30 minutes):

### 1. Review Search Terms Report

- Go to each campaign → Keywords → Search Terms
- Look for irrelevant searches that got clicks
- Add 3-5 new negative keywords per campaign

**What to look for:**
- Wrong products (ACER laptops, other tests)
- Wrong year levels
- Wrong states (NSW searches in VIC campaign)
- Teaching/tutoring services
- Login/portal searches

---

### 2. Check Keyword Performance

**Pause keywords with:**
- 0 clicks after 200+ impressions (not relevant)
- <0.5% CTR after 300+ impressions (bad ad match)
- 0 conversions after 150+ clicks (doesn't convert)

**Note:** Don't pause too early! Give 3-4 weeks minimum.

---

### 3. Review Conversion Data

**Questions to answer:**
- Which campaigns are converting? (scale these!)
- Which keywords drove conversions? (increase bids!)
- What's the CPA per campaign? (optimize losers)

**Actions:**
- Increase budget on converters by 20-30%
- Pause campaigns with 0 conversions after 6 weeks
- Lower bids on high-CPA keywords

---

### 4. Monitor Budget Pacing

**Check if:**
- Campaigns hitting daily budget limit? (increase budget or lower max CPC)
- Not spending full budget? (increase max CPC to $3.50 or add keywords)
- Spending too fast? (lower max CPC to $2.00)

---

# 💡 PRO TIPS

## 1. Why Exact + Phrase Together?

**Exact match [keyword]:**
- Catches people searching EXACTLY for that term
- Highest intent
- Lowest volume
- Lowest CPC

**Phrase match "keyword":**
- Catches variations with the phrase in it
- High intent
- Medium volume
- Medium CPC

**Together = Best of both worlds!**

---

## 2. Why These Negatives?

**Excluded from negatives:**
- ❌ "free" - People searching "free practice test" might buy after trying
- ❌ "sample" - Want to see samples before buying
- ❌ "pdf" - Looking for downloadable materials (we have this!)
- ❌ "papers" - "practice papers" shows high purchase intent
- ❌ "download" - Want to download practice materials

**Included in negatives:**
- ✅ Wrong products (other tests, ACER laptops)
- ✅ Wrong audiences (teachers, tutors, jobs)
