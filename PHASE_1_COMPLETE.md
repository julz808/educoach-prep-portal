# ✅ Phase 1 Implementation Complete

## 🎯 **What I've Implemented for You**

### **✅ 1. Subdomain Detection System**
- **Created**: `src/utils/subdomain.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Detects `learning.educourse.com.au` vs `educourse.com.au`
  - Handles localhost development with port-based detection
  - Provides cross-domain navigation utilities

### **✅ 2. Route Separation**
- **Created**: `src/routes/MarketingRoutes.tsx` - Public marketing pages
- **Created**: `src/routes/LearningRoutes.tsx` - Authenticated learning platform
- **Updated**: `src/App.tsx` - Now conditionally renders routes based on subdomain

### **✅ 3. Cross-Domain Navigation**
- **Updated**: Auth success redirects to learning platform
- **Updated**: Logout redirects to marketing site  
- **Updated**: Purchase success flows to learning platform

### **✅ 4. Development Environment**
- **Created**: Development scripts for both sites
- **Updated**: package.json with new dev commands

## 🚀 **What You Need To Do Now**

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**
```bash
npm install concurrently
```

### **Step 2: Test the Subdomain Routing**

**Option A: Test Both Simultaneously**
```bash
# Run both marketing and learning sites
npm run dev:both
```

**Option B: Test Individually**
```bash
# Marketing site (educourse.com.au simulation)
npm run dev:marketing  # http://localhost:3000

# Learning platform (learning.educourse.com.au simulation) 
npm run dev:learning   # http://localhost:3001
```

### **Step 3: Test the Cross-Domain Flow**

1. **Visit Marketing Site**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Try user registration/login** - should redirect to http://localhost:3001/dashboard
3. **Try course purchase** - should work through the flow
4. **Visit Learning Platform**: http://localhost:3001 - should show dashboard if authenticated

### **Step 4: Verify Route Separation**

**Marketing Site (localhost:3000) should show:**
- ✅ Homepage (Landing page)
- ✅ Course detail pages  
- ✅ Auth pages
- ✅ Purchase success
- ❌ Should NOT show dashboard/learning content

**Learning Platform (localhost:3001) should show:**
- ✅ Dashboard (redirected from root)
- ✅ All learning pages (diagnostic, drill, insights, etc.)
- ✅ Auth callback handling
- ❌ Should NOT show marketing pages

## 🔧 **Current Architecture**

```
Your App
├── Marketing Site (Port 3000)
│   ├── Landing page
│   ├── Course detail pages
│   ├── Auth & purchase flow
│   └── Redirects → Learning Platform
│
└── Learning Platform (Port 3001) 
    ├── Dashboard
    ├── Learning tools
    ├── User management
    └── Redirects → Marketing Site (logout)
```

## 🐛 **Potential Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Import Errors**
If you see import errors, some components might need path adjustments:
```bash
# Check for any missing imports
npm run build
```

### **Issue 2: Auth State Sharing**
Cross-domain auth uses Supabase's built-in session management, but you might need to:
- Test auth persistence across domains
- Verify redirect URLs in Supabase dashboard

### **Issue 3: Environment Variables**
Make sure your `.env` file works for both subdomain configurations.

## 📋 **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Marketing site loads at localhost:3000
- [ ] Learning platform loads at localhost:3001  
- [ ] Login from marketing redirects to learning platform
- [ ] Logout from learning redirects to marketing site
- [ ] Purchase flow works end-to-end
- [ ] All routes work as expected
- [ ] No console errors in either application

## 🎉 **Next Steps After Testing**

Once you've verified everything works locally:

1. **Phase 2**: Set up DNS and domain configuration
2. **Phase 3**: Deploy to separate Vercel projects
3. **Phase 4**: Migrate data from Thinkific
4. **Phase 5**: Set up redirects and go live

## 🆘 **If Something Doesn't Work**

**Common fixes:**
```bash
# Clear npm cache and reinstall
npm cache clean --force
npm install

# Clear browser cache and localStorage
# Check browser console for errors
# Verify environment variables are set
```

**Let me know if you encounter any issues and I'll help debug!**
