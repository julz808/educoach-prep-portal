VISUAL GENERATION: FALSE
- Create a text-only question that can be fully answered without any visual aid
- This sub-skill normally requires visuals, so provide all necessary data within the question text
- Describe any shapes, charts, or spatial relationships clearly in words
- Include all numerical data, measurements, and relationships in the question text

üö´ CRITICAL: AVOID OVERLY VERBOSE VISUAL DESCRIPTIONS
When describing visual elements in text, follow these guidelines:

**CONCISE DESCRIPTION PRINCIPLES:**
- Keep visual descriptions SHORT and FOCUSED - maximum 2-3 sentences
- Use BULLET POINTS or STRUCTURED FORMAT for complex data instead of long paragraphs
- Present only ESSENTIAL visual information needed to answer the question
- Avoid lengthy descriptions that overwhelm students

**PREFERRED FORMATS for different visual types (EXAMPLES ONLY - adapt to your question topic):**

**For GEOMETRIC SHAPES:**
‚ùå BAD: "Imagine a complex geometric figure where there is a large rectangle positioned horizontally with dimensions that measure 12 centimetres in length and 8 centimetres in width, and attached to this rectangle is a triangular shape..."
‚úÖ GOOD: "A rectangle (12cm √ó 8cm) has a triangle attached to its right side. The triangle has a base of 8cm and height of 6cm."
*Note: Your question doesn't have to be about rectangles - use any appropriate geometric shape for your question*

**For DATA/CHARTS:**
‚ùå BAD: "Consider a detailed bar chart showing multiple data points where the first bar represents 45 students who chose mathematics, the second bar shows 32 students who selected science, the third bar indicates 28 students who picked..."
‚úÖ GOOD: "Student subject preferences: Mathematics (45), Science (32), English (28), Art (15)."
*Note: Your question doesn't have to be about student preferences - use any appropriate data set for your question*

**For TABLES:**
‚ùå BAD: "Examine the following complex table which displays information in rows and columns where the first row contains headers and subsequent rows show..."
‚úÖ GOOD: Use a simple formatted table or list the key data points clearly.
*Note: Adapt table format to whatever data your question requires*

**STRUCTURE GUIDELINES:**
1. **Lead with the question concept**, not the visual description
2. **Integrate data naturally** into the question flow
3. **Use formatting** (parentheses, colons, bullet points) to organize information clearly
4. **Focus on mathematical relationships** rather than visual appearance

**EXAMPLE TRANSFORMATIONS (adapt the approach, not the specific topic):**
‚ùå "Look at this rectangular garden bed which has been designed with specific measurements where the length is exactly three times longer than the width, and if you were to calculate the width as being 4 metres, then you would need to determine..."
‚úÖ "A rectangular garden bed has a width of 4m and a length three times the width. What is the perimeter?"
*Note: Use this concise approach for ANY topic - doesn't have to be garden beds*`;

    }
  }

  return `
VISUAL GENERATION: TRUE
- Create a question that requires the visual component to be answered
- Use one of these visual types: ${visualTypes?.join(', ') || 'any appropriate type'}

CRITICAL VISUAL REQUIREMENTS:
- visual_data: A detailed written description of the visual that explains what is shown, including all data points, labels, measurements, and visual elements
- visual_svg: Complete, precise SVG code that can be rendered exactly as intended with zero ambiguity

SVG CODE REQUIREMENTS:
- Must be completely self-contained with all necessary styling and definitions
- Include ALL data, labels, measurements, and visual elements needed to answer the question
- Do NOT include answers, solutions, clues, or guidance within the visual
- Include only what students need to see to solve the question independently
- Must be detailed enough that any graphic designer or AI system can render it perfectly without asking clarification questions
- Leave absolutely no room for interpretation or guesswork in the SVG implementation

VISUAL DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS:
- Dimensions: Width 300-450px, Height 250-350px
- Use Australian/UK spelling in any text within visuals
- Professional color scheme: Primary (#3498DB), Accent (#E74C3C), Text (#2C3E50)
- Clear, readable labels and measurements when referenced in question
- No assessment branding, meta-information, or identifying marks
- Use Arial/sans-serif fonts, sizes 11-14px for optimal readability
- Ensure high contrast and professional appearance
- Include proper CSS styles within <style> tags in the SVG

DATA COMPLETENESS:
- All numerical values must be clearly labeled and positioned
- All axes, gridlines, and reference points must be precisely defined
- All shapes, angles, and measurements must be exact and clearly marked
- Colors and styling must be consistent and purposeful`;

üî¨ MANDATORY MATHEMATICAL VERIFICATION PROTOCOL

Before finalizing your response, you MUST complete this verification checklist:

‚úÖ STEP-BY-STEP VERIFICATION:
1. Work through the problem completely from scratch
2. Double-check each calculation independently  
3. Verify your final answer matches exactly ONE of the provided options
4. Confirm no mathematical errors or impossible results

üö´ CRITICAL STOP CONDITIONS - REGENERATE IF ANY APPLY:
- Your calculated answer doesn't match any option exactly
- You feel uncertain about any calculation step
- Multiple options seem potentially correct
- You need to "recalculate" or "try again" during solving
- The problem seems to have no solution or multiple valid solutions
- You notice ANY contradiction between question, options, and solution

‚ö†Ô∏è HALLUCINATION PREVENTION:
- NEVER use phrases like "let me recalculate", "wait, let me", "actually, let me"
- If you catch an error, START COMPLETELY OVER rather than patching
- Your explanation must flow logically without hesitation or correction
- Be certain of your mathematical work before writing the solution

VERIFICATION STATEMENT REQUIRED:
End your solution with: "Mathematical verification: Confirmed"
If you cannot make this statement with complete confidence, regenerate the question.

- Vary between abstract and contextual approaches
- Mix question types and structures naturally

‚úÖ AUTHENTIC QUESTION STRUCTURES for ${testType}:

MATHEMATICS REASONING - Mix these approaches:

**ABSTRACT/CONCEPTUAL (often the clearest approach):**
‚Ä¢ "Simplify the expression: 4x¬≤ - 3x + 7 - (2x¬≤ + x - 1)"
‚Ä¢ "What is the value of 3/4 √∑ 2/3?"
‚Ä¢ "A regular hexagon has a perimeter of 42 cm. What is the length of each side?"
‚Ä¢ "If f(x) = 2x + 5, what is the value of f(3)?"

**DATA/MEASUREMENT (clear and practical):**
‚Ä¢ "The table shows rainfall measurements for each month. What is the median rainfall?"
‚Ä¢ "A rectangular prism has dimensions 8cm √ó 5cm √ó 3cm. Calculate its volume."
‚Ä¢ "The graph displays population growth over 10 years. What was the percentage increase from Year 2 to Year 5?"

**MINIMAL CONTEXT (when story helps understanding):**
‚Ä¢ "A recipe requires 3/4 cup of flour. How much flour is needed for 2.5 batches?"
‚Ä¢ "Concert tickets cost $45 each. If 180 tickets are sold, what is the total revenue?"
‚Ä¢ "A cyclist travels 24km in 90 minutes. What is their average speed in km/h?"

**REAL-WORLD APPLICATION (when context adds value):**
‚Ä¢ "The local council plans to fence a rectangular park. If the park measures 80m by 45m and fencing costs $12 per metre, what is the total cost?"

READING REASONING - Based on passage content:
‚Ä¢ "What is the main argument presented in paragraph 3?"
‚Ä¢ "How does the author's use of metaphor contribute to the overall theme?"
‚Ä¢ "Based on the evidence provided, what can be inferred about the character's motivation?"
‚Ä¢ "Which statement best summarises the relationship between the two concepts discussed?"

KEY PRINCIPLES:
1. **Choose the clearest approach** - Don't add unnecessary complexity
2. **Abstract when possible** - Many math questions are cleaner without stories
3. **Context when helpful** - Use stories/characters only when they aid understanding
4. **Data-focused** - Tables, graphs, measurements often work well
5. **Variety in difficulty** - Simple direct questions AND multi-step problems
6. **Natural language** - Avoid artificial or forced scenarios

PASSAGE REFERENCE:
This question must reference the following passage. Students will have read this passage and the question should test their understanding of it.

PASSAGE CONTENT:
${passageContent}

PASSAGE-BASED QUESTION REQUIREMENTS:
- Question must specifically reference content from the passage
- Cannot be answered without reading the passage
- Test the specific sub-skill in relation to the passage content
- Reference specific details, characters, events, or information from the passage
` : ''}

ANSWER OPTIONS & DISTRACTOR GENERATION (Multiple Choice Only):
- Exactly 4 options formatted as: A) option, B) option, C) option, D) option
- Ensure roughly even distribution of correct answers across A, B, C, D
- Avoid "All of the above" or "None of the above" unless authentic to this test type

üéØ DISTRACTOR QUALITY MANDATE - CRITICAL FOR VALID ASSESSMENT:
For each wrong answer option, you MUST ensure it is:
1. ‚úÖ Plausible enough that a student might reasonably choose it
2. ‚úÖ Definitively wrong - cannot be defended as correct under any interpretation
3. ‚úÖ Based on common student errors, misconceptions, or logical mistakes
4. ‚úÖ Clear and unambiguous in its incorrectness

üö´ FORBIDDEN DISTRACTOR TYPES - NEVER CREATE THESE:
- Answers that could be correct under different interpretations of the question
- Options that are "technically correct" in some contexts but wrong for this specific question
- Answers that require specialized outside knowledge to eliminate
- Mathematical results from reasonable alternative methods that could also be valid
- Partial answers that are "somewhat correct" or "on the right track"

‚úÖ HIGH-QUALITY DISTRACTOR STRATEGIES BY SUBJECT:

**Mathematics:** Common calculation errors (wrong order of operations, sign errors, formula mistakes), reversed operations, using wrong formulas that seem logical
**Reading Comprehension:** Details from wrong parts of text, reasonable but unsupported inferences, confusing similar concepts from the passage
**Verbal Reasoning:** Relationships that sound logical but don't match the actual pattern, reversed analogies, category confusion
**Language Conventions:** Grammar rules that apply in other contexts but not this specific case, common spelling mistakes, punctuation confusion

üîç MANDATORY SELF-CHECK BEFORE FINALIZING:
Before completing your response, ask yourself for each wrong option:
"Could a knowledgeable teacher or student defend this answer as potentially correct?"
If YES to any option: Revise that distractor until it's clearly wrong but still plausible.

DISTRACTOR AUTHENTICITY FOR ${testType}:
- Use errors that Year ${yearLevel} students commonly make in ${sectionName}
- Avoid obvious "throwaway" options that no student would choose
- Make distractors challenging enough to differentiate student ability levels

${!isWritingSection ? `
FINAL QUALITY CONTROL - MANDATORY SELF-VERIFICATION:
Before completing your response, work through this checklist:

üîç ANSWER UNIQUENESS CHECK:
‚úÖ EXACTLY ONE CORRECT ANSWER: Verify only one option is definitively correct
‚úÖ DISTRACTOR VERIFICATION: Re-read each wrong answer and confirm it cannot be defended as correct
‚úÖ NO AMBIGUITY: Question has only one reasonable interpretation
‚úÖ AUTHENTIC FOR ${testType}: Question style, difficulty, and content match real ${testType} standards

üîç MATHEMATICAL/LOGICAL ACCURACY CHECK (if applicable):
‚úÖ CALCULATION VERIFICATION: Double-check all mathematical work step-by-step
‚úÖ FORMULA ACCURACY: Ensure correct formulas and procedures are used
‚úÖ LOGICAL CONSISTENCY: Answer follows logically from given information
‚úÖ REASONABLE RESULT: Answer makes sense in the context of the problem

üö® REGENERATION FLAGS (use "VALIDATION_FLAG" if ANY apply):
- You cannot confidently verify that exactly one answer is correct
- Your calculated answer doesn't match any of the 4 options you created
- You feel uncertain about the mathematical or logical correctness
- The question seems to have no valid solution or multiple valid solutions
- You notice any contradictions between question, options, and solution

ENHANCED SOLUTION FORMAT - MANDATORY STRUCTURE:
Your solution must follow this EXACT format to provide educational value:

**Correct Answer: [Letter]**
[Brief, clear explanation of why this answer is correct]

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- A: [Specific reason why this option is incorrect]
- B: [Specific reason why this option is incorrect]  
- C: [Specific reason why this option is incorrect]
- D: [Specific reason why this option is incorrect]
(Note: Skip the letter that is correct)

**Tips for Similar Questions:**
‚Ä¢ [Specific strategy or technique for this type of question]
‚Ä¢ [Pattern recognition or approach that helps with similar problems]  
‚Ä¢ [Common mistake to avoid or verification method]

EDUCATIONAL TIP EXAMPLES FOR ${sectionName} - ${subSkill}:
${formatTipsForExplanation(selectRelevantTips(sectionName, subSkill))}

SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS:
- Start with "VALIDATION_FLAG" if any validation issues detected
- Use the structured format above for ALL solutions
- Provide specific, actionable tips that transfer to similar questions
- Focus on teaching strategy, not just explaining this specific answer
- Make tips appropriate for Year ${yearLevel} students taking ${testType}
` : `
WRITING SECTION REQUIREMENTS:
- Provide a simple, clear task instruction only
- Do not include validation flags for writing prompts
- Keep the prompt focused and appropriate for the target year level

NARRATIVE FLOW GUIDELINES:
- Use names naturally within the story context - AVOID starting with full names
- Vary your opening approaches: action, dialogue, description, or reflection
- You can introduce characters gradually (e.g., "The young researcher...", then reveal the name later)
- Consider starting with: setting, action, dialogue, or internal thoughts
- Mix first names, last names, and descriptive references naturally

EXAMPLES OF NATURAL OPENINGS:
- "The laboratory door creaked as someone entered..." (then introduce the character)
- "'We need to hurry,' whispered a voice in the darkness..." (dialogue first)
- "Every morning brought new discoveries..." (setting/theme first)
