As he climbed into the cockpit of the small Cessna, his hands trembled slightly. The radio crackled with instructions from the control tower. Jack's heart pounded as he pushed the throttle forward and felt the plane accelerate down the runway. He pulled back on the yoke, and the ground gradually fell away beneath him. For the first time, he was alone in the sky, completely responsible for the aircraft. The fear he initially felt transformed into a sense of confidence and freedom. He circled the airport several times, practicing the maneuvers he had learned in his lessons. Looking down at the landscape below, Jack felt an overwhelming sense of joy and accomplishment.",

While Bill remained in his underground shelter with plenty of stored food, Gary found himself cold, hungry, and desperate. Despite his pride, Gary asked Bill for help. Bill, showing compassion, took Gary in and shared his food. As winter progressed, Gary worked alongside Bill. When spring arrived, Gary emerged a changed insect.
