ARTICLE TITLE:
EduTest Written Expression 2026: How to Score in 90th Percentile

INTRODUCTION:

Written Expression often determines scholarship outcomes. While Quantitative and Verbal Reasoning measure reasoning abilities that develop gradually, writing performance can improve dramatically with strategic practice and technique mastery. Students scoring in the 60th-70th percentile can reach 85th-90th+ percentile through focused writing development.

Unlike multiple-choice sections where partial knowledge earns no points, writing rewards improvement in specific skill areas. Mastering essay structure adds points even if vocabulary remains moderate. Developing planning techniques improves organization scores regardless of creative flair. Strategic skill-building creates measurable score increases.

This comprehensive guide explains everything needed for top-tier Written Expression performance: the precise rubric and scoring system, prompt types (persuasive vs narrative), planning strategies that maximize the 30-minute timeframe, structural approaches for both essay types, techniques for developing ideas with depth, language and vocabulary strategies, common mistakes costing points, and a practice framework for systematic improvement.
