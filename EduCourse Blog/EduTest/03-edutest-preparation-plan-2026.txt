ARTICLE TITLE:
EduTest Preparation 2026: Complete 10-Week Study Plan

INTRODUCTION:

Ten weeks provides sufficient time to build the reasoning skills, test-taking strategies, and confidence needed for strong EduTest performance—without the stress of last-minute cramming or the inefficiency of overly prolonged preparation that loses focus.

Unlike curriculum-based tests where more study time always helps, EduTest measures cognitive reasoning abilities that develop through consistent, strategic practice over time. The optimal preparation window balances sufficient skill development with maintained motivation and focus. Too short (under 6 weeks), and students lack time to develop nuanced reasoning skills; too long (over 4-5 months), and preparation loses intensity and students risk burnout.

This comprehensive 10-week study plan provides a week-by-week roadmap covering all three EduTest sections—Quantitative Reasoning, Verbal Reasoning, and Written Expression—with specific daily activities, practice schedules, skill-building focus, and progress checkpoints. Whether your child is starting from strong foundations or needs significant development, this structured approach ensures systematic preparation that peaks at test day.


H3: Preparation Philosophy and Approach

Understanding the strategic framework behind this plan helps you execute it effectively.

H2: Build Skills First, Then Speed

Weeks 1-6 focus on building reasoning skills and learning strategies with less emphasis on timing. Weeks 7-10 progressively add time pressure and test simulation.

This sequence ensures students develop correct approaches before adding the stress of time constraints—preventing the common mistake of practicing fast but ineffective strategies.

H2: Balanced Section Development

Each week includes work across all three sections to maintain balanced skill development. However, each section gets primary focus for specific weeks to allow deeper skill-building:
- Weeks 1-3: Quantitative Reasoning emphasis
- Weeks 4-6: Verbal Reasoning emphasis  
- Weeks 7-10: Written Expression emphasis with integrated practice across all sections

H2: Incremental Difficulty Progression

Practice questions and activities follow a carefully sequenced difficulty progression:
- Weeks 1-4: Foundational skills with moderate difficulty
- Weeks 5-7: Challenging problems requiring advanced reasoning
- Weeks 8-10: EduTest-level difficulty with unfamiliar problem types

This progression builds confidence while systematically developing higher-level thinking skills.

H2: Regular Assessment and Adjustment

Built-in checkpoints (Weeks 3, 6, 9) include diagnostic assessments revealing strengths and gaps. Use these results to adjust focus for subsequent weeks—spending more time on weaker areas while maintaining stronger skills.

H3: Adjustments for Different Starting Points

Modify this plan based on your child's current skill level.

H2: For Students Starting with Strong Foundations

If diagnostic assessment (Week 1) shows 75th+ percentile baseline:
- Reduce Weeks 1-4 foundation building; move more quickly to challenging materials
- Add more time to Weeks 7-10 with additional full-length practice tests
- Focus primarily on unfamiliar question types and maintaining speed with accuracy

H2: For Students Needing Significant Development

If diagnostic shows below 50th percentile baseline:
- Extend foundation building (Weeks 1-4) by repeating content before progressing
- Spend more time on fundamental skills (mental math, basic vocabulary, essay structure)
- Reduce number of full practice tests; focus more on skill-building exercises
- Consider extending overall timeline to 12-14 weeks for thorough development

H2: For Students with Unbalanced Section Performance

If diagnostic shows significant variance (e.g., 85th percentile Quantitative, 60th percentile Verbal):
- Allocate more time to weaker section(s) throughout all weeks
- Maintain but don't over-invest in strong section(s)
