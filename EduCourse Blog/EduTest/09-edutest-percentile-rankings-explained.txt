ARTICLE TITLE:
EduTest Percentile Rankings Explained: What Your Score Means

INTRODUCTION:

You receive your child's EduTest results, and the report shows percentile rankings: Overall 87th percentile, Quantitative 92nd percentile, Verbal 81st percentile, Written Expression 84th percentile. What do these numbers actually mean? Are these scores strong enough for the scholarship program you're targeting? Should you be celebrating or concerned?

Understanding percentile rankings—what they measure, how they're calculated, what different ranges indicate, and most importantly, how schools use them for selection decisions—is essential for interpreting your child's results and making informed decisions about applications and next steps.

This comprehensive guide explains everything about EduTest percentile rankings: how percentiles differ from raw scores, what age-based comparison means, interpretation of different percentile ranges, how schools use scores for scholarships and program entry, what happens when section scores vary significantly, and realistic expectations for different preparation levels.
