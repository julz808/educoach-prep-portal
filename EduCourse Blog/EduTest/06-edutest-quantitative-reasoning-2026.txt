IMAGEN PROMPT:
Create a modern, clean educational featured image for "EduTest Quantitative Reasoning 2026: Complete Guide". The composition should feature mathematical and quantitative elements: numbers, geometric shapes (triangles, circles, squares), graphs/charts, calculator or mathematical symbols (+, -, ×, ÷, =), and data visualization elements. Use a gradient background from light teal (#E6F7F5) to white. Incorporate teal (#4ECDC4) for geometric shapes and mathematical elements, and coral (#FF6B6B) for problem-solving indicators, solution paths, and success symbols. Include subtle visual elements like puzzle pieces suggesting problem-solving, ascending bar charts showing progress, or pattern sequences. The design should feel logical, analytical, and confidence-building. Use flat design with soft shadows and rounded corners. Keep it uncluttered with generous white space. No people or photos - use abstract mathematical iconography.

ARTICLE TITLE:
EduTest Quantitative Reasoning 2026: Complete Guide

INTRODUCTION:

Quantitative Reasoning is often the section where strong math students feel surprised by difficulty. Unlike school mathematics tests that assess curriculum mastery through familiar problem types, EduTest Quantitative Reasoning measures mathematical thinking and problem-solving ability using unfamiliar scenarios that require flexible reasoning rather than memorized procedures.

Success depends on strategic problem-solving approaches, efficient mental mathematics (no calculator permitted), pattern recognition, and the ability to apply mathematical thinking to novel situations. Students who rely solely on school math skills without developing these additional capacities often underperform relative to their mathematical ability.

This comprehensive guide covers everything needed to excel in EduTest Quantitative Reasoning: the precise section format, mathematical content areas, question types, mental calculation strategies, systematic problem-solving frameworks, time management techniques, and common mistakes to avoid.
