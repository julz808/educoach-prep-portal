Use a gradient background from light teal (#E6F7F5) to white. Incorporate teal (#4ECDC4) for preparation checklist items and organization elements, and coral (#FF6B6B) for success indicators, achievement badges, and readiness symbols. Include subtle visual elements like a calendar marked with test day, a water bottle, pencils, or a path leading to success. The design should feel organized, calm, and confidence-building. Use flat design with soft shadows and rounded corners. Keep it uncluttered with generous white space. No people or photos - use simple iconography.

ARTICLE TITLE:
EduTest Day Strategy 2026: Expert Tips for Success

INTRODUCTION:

You've spent weeks or months preparing for EduTest—building reasoning skills, practicing question types, and completing timed simulations. Now test day approaches, and you want to ensure all that preparation translates into optimal performance when it matters most.

Test-day strategy significantly impacts results. Students who arrive prepared with the right materials, use effective timing strategies for each section, and manage stress appropriately often outperform equally skilled students who lack these tactical approaches.

This comprehensive guide covers everything for peak EduTest performance: preparation the night before, what to bring (and what to leave home), section-by-section timing tactics, strategies for difficult questions, stress management techniques, and post-test considerations.
