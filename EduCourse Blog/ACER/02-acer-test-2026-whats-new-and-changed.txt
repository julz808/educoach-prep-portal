ARTICLE TITLE:
ACER Test 2026: What's New and Changed This Year

INTRODUCTION:

You've researched the ACER scholarship test before—perhaps your older child sat it in 2025, or you started preparation planning months ago. Now you're wondering: has anything changed for 2026?

Staying current with test format updates, timing adjustments, and policy changes ensures your child's preparation remains relevant and effective. This article covers all confirmed and expected changes to the ACER scholarship test for 2026, comparing it to previous years so you can adjust your preparation strategy accordingly.

While the core structure of the ACER test remains consistent, understanding even minor updates helps you avoid outdated practice materials and ensures your child knows exactly what to expect on test day.


H3: Overview of ACER Test Stability

Before diving into specific changes, it's important to understand ACER's approach to test development. The Australian Council for Educational Research maintains high standards of test reliability and validity, which means the core assessment framework remains relatively stable year to year.

This stability serves important purposes:
- Ensures fair comparison of results across different test administrations
- Allows schools to maintain consistent scholarship standards
- Provides predictable preparation pathways for families
- Maintains the psychometric integrity of percentile rankings

Major structural changes are rare and typically announced well in advance. Most year-to-year variations involve refinement rather than complete overhaul.


H3: Confirmed Changes for 2026

As of January 2026, the following aspects of the ACER scholarship test remain unchanged from 2025:

H2: Test Structure Remains Constant

The four-section format continues for 2026:
- Reading Comprehension (30 questions, 30 minutes)
- Mathematics (30 questions, 30 minutes)
- Verbal Reasoning (30 questions, 25 minutes)
- Abstract Reasoning (30 questions, 25 minutes)

Total testing time remains 110 minutes of active assessment, plus additional time for instructions and breaks between sections.

H2: Question Formats Unchanged

All sections continue to use multiple-choice format with four or five answer options per question. There are no plans to introduce open-ended response questions or technology-enhanced items for 2026.

H2: Scoring System Consistent

Results continue to be reported as percentile rankings comparing your child's performance to a norming group of students at similar year levels. Raw scores (number correct) are also provided, but percentile rankings remain the primary metric schools use for scholarship decisions.


H3: Potential Updates to Monitor

While no major changes have been announced, families should stay informed about these areas where minor adjustments sometimes occur:

H2: Content Emphasis Adjustments

ACER periodically reviews question content to ensure alignment with contemporary educational standards. For 2026, this may include:

Mathematics Section:
- Continued emphasis on problem-solving over computation
- Possible increased focus on data interpretation and graphs
- Questions reflecting real-world mathematical applications

Reading Section:
- Diverse text types including digital and multimodal formats
- Contemporary topics relevant to current students
- Balance of literary and informational passages

Verbal and Abstract Reasoning:
- These sections typically see minimal content changes as they test fundamental cognitive abilities rather than curriculum knowledge

H2: Question Difficulty Calibration

ACER continuously calibrates question difficulty through extensive trialling. For 2026, you may notice:
- Subtle shifts in the distribution of easy, medium, and difficult questions
- Refinement of questions based on previous years' performance data
- Removal of questions that showed bias or statistical anomalies

These adjustments improve test quality but don't fundamentally change preparation strategies.

H3: Administrative and Policy Updates

Some schools and testing centres have implemented procedural changes for 2026:

H2: Testing Window Expansion

Several schools have extended their testing windows for 2026, offering multiple test dates to accommodate more families. This provides greater scheduling flexibility but also means registration deadlines may vary by date.

Check directly with your target school for specific dates and registration cutoffs.

H2: Digital Testing Considerations

While ACER scholarship tests are still primarily administered in paper format, some testing centres are piloting digital delivery for specific sections. If your child's school uses digital testing:

- The question content and format remain identical to paper versions
- Students should familiarise themselves with basic computer navigation
- Calculator restrictions still apply for Mathematics sections
- Scratch paper is provided for working

Confirm with your school whether testing will be paper-based or digital.

H2: Accommodations and Accessibility

ACER continues to refine provisions for students with documented learning differences or disabilities. For 2026:
- Extended time provisions remain available with appropriate documentation
- Alternative format options may be expanded
- Application processes for accommodations should begin early (typically 6-8 weeks before the test date)

Families requiring accommodations should contact schools directly to understand specific requirements and deadlines.


H3: What Hasn't Changed (And Why That Matters)

Understanding what remains consistent helps you use preparation resources effectively:

H2: Core Skills Assessed

The fundamental reasoning abilities ACER tests have not changed:
- Reading comprehension and inference
- Mathematical reasoning and problem-solving
- Verbal logical thinking and word relationships
- Abstract pattern recognition

This means quality practice materials from recent years remain highly relevant for 2026 preparation.

H2: Time Pressure Remains Significant

The ratio of questions to available time continues to challenge most students. Time management strategies remain a critical component of effective preparation.

Your child should practice:
- Pacing themselves to attempt all questions
- Quickly identifying and skipping difficult questions
- Efficient answer marking and time tracking

H2: No Negative Marking

ACER does not penalise incorrect answers. This means guessing strategically on uncertain questions remains a sound test-taking strategy. This policy has not changed for 2026.


H3: How Changes (or Lack Thereof) Affect Your Preparation

H2: Use Recent Practice Materials

Since no major format changes have occurred, official ACER practice tests from recent years accurately represent the 2026 test experience. Practice materials from 2024 and 2025 remain highly relevant.

Focus on:
- Official ACER practice tests (most accurate representation)
- Reputable test preparation publishers with recently updated materials
- Practice resources specifically designed for ACER scholarship tests

Avoid materials that are more than 3-4 years old, as question styles and topics may have gradually shifted.

H2: Maintain Balanced Preparation

With all four sections maintaining their structure and weighting, continue allocating preparation time across all areas:
- Don't neglect sections your child finds easier
- Address weaknesses systematically
- Practice under full timed conditions regularly

H2: Stay Updated on School-Specific Information

While the ACER test itself remains consistent, individual schools may adjust:
- Testing dates and registration deadlines
- Percentile thresholds for scholarship consideration
- How ACER results are weighted against other application components

Check school websites regularly and subscribe to updates from schools on your child's target list.


H3: Looking Ahead: Potential Future Changes

While not implemented for 2026, ACER and participating schools continue discussing potential future developments:

H2: Increased Digital Testing

The broader educational assessment sector is gradually shifting toward digital delivery. Future ACER administrations may increasingly adopt digital formats, though this transition will be gradual and carefully managed.

H2: Enhanced Score Reporting

Schools have expressed interest in more detailed diagnostic feedback beyond overall percentile rankings. Future iterations might provide more granular sub-skill analysis.

H2: Adaptive Testing Possibilities

Computer-adaptive testing, where question difficulty adjusts based on student responses, represents a potential long-term development, though no concrete plans have been announced.


H3: How to Verify Current Information

Relying on accurate, current information is essential. Here's how to stay informed:

H2: Official Sources

- ACER official website: www.acer.org (check for announcements)
- Individual school websites: Most schools publish specific test information in their admissions sections
- School admission offices: Direct contact provides the most reliable school-specific information

H2: What to Avoid

- Outdated forum posts or discussions from previous years
- Unofficial "insider information" or rumours
- Preparation services making claims about "secret changes"

When in doubt, verify directly with official sources.


H3: Practical Steps for 2026 Test Takers

Given the current state of information about 2026 changes:

1. Proceed with Confidence
The test fundamentals remain consistent. Quality preparation focusing on the four core sections will serve your child well.

2. Use Current Materials
Recent official ACER practice tests and up-to-date preparation resources accurately reflect what your child will encounter.

3. Verify School-Specific Details
Confirm exact test dates, registration deadlines, and format (paper vs. digital) with your specific target schools.

4. Monitor for Updates
Check official sources periodically between now and your test date for any newly announced adjustments.

5. Focus on Fundamentals
Regardless of minor changes, strong reasoning skills, time management, and familiarity with question formats remain the keys to success.


H3: Common Questions About Test Changes

H2: Should I Delay Preparation While Waiting for More Information?

No. The core test structure is confirmed. Beginning systematic preparation now is more beneficial than waiting for potential minor adjustments that may never materialise.

H2: Are Practice Tests from 2024 and 2025 Still Useful?

Absolutely. These materials accurately represent the question styles, difficulty levels, and timing your child will encounter in 2026.

H2: Will There Be More Changes Throughout the Year?

Major mid-year changes are extremely unlikely as they would compromise test fairness. Any adjustments would typically be announced well in advance and implemented for the following year.
