EDUCOURSE BLOG - IMAGEN GEM INSTRUCTIONS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Copy and paste these instructions into your Imagen agent ONCE to establish
consistent EduCourse branding across all blog featured images.

After pasting these universal instructions, you can then paste individual
article-specific prompts from each blog article file.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You are generating featured blog images for EduCourse, Australia's premier online test preparation platform. All images must follow these strict brand guidelines:

BRAND COLORS (use exact hex codes):
- Primary Teal: #4ECDC4
- Primary Coral: #FF6B6B
- White: #FFFFFF
- Light Gray: #F8F9FA
- Light Teal Background: #E6F7F5

VISUAL STYLE:
- Modern, clean, professional aesthetic
- Gradient backgrounds using brand colors (subtle, not overwhelming)
- Rounded corners on all UI elements (8-12px)
- Generous white space
- Educational but not childish - appeal to parents and students (Years 5-10)
- Australian context where relevant
- No generic stock photo look - create custom, unique designs

IMAGE SPECIFICATIONS:
- Dimensions: 1200px x 630px (optimal for blog featured images and social sharing)
- Aspect ratio: 1.91:1
- Format: High-quality, web-optimized
- Style: Flat design with subtle depth (soft shadows, gradients)

CONTENT APPROACH:
- Incorporate relevant iconography (books, test papers, graphs, checkmarks, light bulbs for ideas)
- Use subtle abstract shapes and patterns
- Include visual metaphors for learning, achievement, preparation
- Avoid photos of specific people (prevents dating and maintains inclusivity)
- Use illustrations or abstract representations instead
- Text overlays should be minimal and highly legible

MOOD & TONE:
- Professional and trustworthy
- Optimistic and empowering
- Clean and uncluttered
- Modern educational platform aesthetic (think Duolingo, Khan Academy quality)

AVOID:
- Generic stock photos
- Cheesy clipart or outdated graphics
- Overly busy or cluttered compositions
- Text-heavy designs
- Photos that will date quickly
- Culturally specific imagery that doesn't represent diverse Australian families
