ARTICLE TITLE:
EduTest Quantitative Reasoning 2026: Complete Guide

INTRODUCTION:

Quantitative Reasoning is often the section where strong maths students feel surprised by difficulty. Unlike school mathematics tests that assess curriculum mastery through familiar problem types, EduTest Quantitative Reasoning measures mathematical thinking and problem-solving ability using unfamiliar scenarios that require flexible reasoning rather than memorised procedures.

Success depends on strategic problem-solving approaches, efficient mental mathematics (no calculator permitted), pattern recognition, and the ability to apply mathematical thinking to novel situations. Students who rely solely on school maths skills without developing these additional capacities often underperform relative to their mathematical ability.

This comprehensive guide covers everything needed to excel in EduTest Quantitative Reasoning: the precise section format, mathematical content areas, question types, mental calculation strategies, systematic problem-solving frameworks, time management techniques, and common mistakes to avoid.


SECTION FORMAT AND STRUCTURE

Understanding exactly what the Quantitative Reasoning section contains helps target preparation effectively.

H3: Time and Question Count

Section Specifications:
- 35-40 minutes total
- 30-35 multiple-choice questions
- No calculator permitted
- 4-5 answer options per question

Timing Challenge:
With approximately 1 minute per question, successful students must balance speed with accuracy. Questions requiring extensive calculation pose time management challenges without calculator assistance.

H3: Answer Format

Multiple-Choice Structure:
All questions present answer options rather than requiring students to generate answers. This offers both advantages (can eliminate wrong answers and test options) and challenges (similar-looking options designed to trap common mistakes).

No Penalty for Guessing:
Wrong answers don't subtract points. Always provide an answer rather than leaving questions blank.


MATHEMATICAL CONTENT AREAS

Quantitative Reasoning assesses broad mathematical thinking across multiple content strands.

H3: Number and Arithmetic

Topics Covered:
- Operations with whole numbers, fractions, decimals, and percentages
- Number properties (even/odd, prime, factors, multiples)
- Order of operations
- Ratio and proportion
- Percentage calculations and applications
- Estimation and approximation

Question Style:
These questions test conceptual understanding and calculation efficiency. Common challenges include multi-step percentage problems, fraction operations without calculator, and ratio word problems requiring setup.

Key Skills:

Questions require extracting information from visual representations and performing calculations or comparisons. Time challenges arise from questions requiring multiple data points or calculations from graphs.

Key Skills:
- Quickly extracting relevant information from displays
- Comparing datasets efficiently
- Calculating probabilities from scenarios
- Identifying trends and patterns in data


COMMON QUESTION TYPES

Understanding specific question formats helps develop targeted strategies.

H3: Word Problems

Challenge:
Translating written scenarios into mathematical operations and solving efficiently without calculator.

Strategy:
1. Read entire problem carefully, identifying what's asked
2. Extract relevant numerical information
3. Determine required mathematical operation(s)
4. Estimate expected answer range
5. Solve systematically
6. Check answer reasonableness

Common Traps:
- Multi-step problems where students solve only partway
- Unnecessary information included to confuse
- Similar answer options differing by calculation errors

H3: Pattern and Sequence Questions

Challenge:
Identifying rules governing number or shape sequences from limited examples.

Strategy:
1. Examine differences between consecutive terms
2. Test for arithmetic patterns (constant addition/subtraction)
3. Test for geometric patterns (multiplication/division)
4. Consider alternating patterns or multiple rules
5. Verify rule works for all given terms
6. Apply rule to find requested term

Success Factors:
Systematic testing beats random guessing. Work through pattern possibilities methodically rather than jumping to conclusions from first observation.

H3: Comparison and Ordering Questions

Challenge:
Determining relative values of fractions, decimals, expressions, or measurements.

Strategy:
1. Convert to common format when possible (all decimals or all fractions)
2. Use benchmarks (½, 0.5, 50%) for quick comparisons
3. Estimate where precision isn't needed
4. Eliminate obviously incorrect options first

Time-Saving Approaches:
Don't convert everything precisely if relative comparison is sufficient. Recognising that 7/12 is slightly more than ½ while 4/9 is slightly less often provides sufficient comparison without calculation.

H3: Applied Problem-Solving

Challenge:
Novel scenarios requiring mathematical thinking in unfamiliar contexts.

Strategy:
1. Don't panic if situation seems unusual
2. Identify what mathematical concept applies (ratio, percentage, geometry, etc.)
3. Set up problem systematically
4. Test answer options if unclear how to proceed
5. Estimate and eliminate unreasonable answers

These questions separate strong mathematical thinkers from students who've only memorised procedures. Success requires staying calm and methodically applying mathematical reasoning.

ESSENTIAL MENTAL MATHS STRATEGIES

Without calculator access, mental calculation efficiency dramatically impacts performance.

H3: Fraction Calculations

Key Techniques:
- Simplify before multiplying (reduce common factors first)
- For fraction division, multiply by reciprocal
- Find common denominators for addition/subtraction
- Convert to decimals when easier

Time-Saving Tip:
Recognise common fraction-decimal equivalents instantly: ¼ = 0.25, ⅓ ≈ 0.33, ⅔ ≈ 0.67, ¾ = 0.75, ⅕ = 0.2

H3: Percentage Calculations

Efficient Approaches:
- 10% = divide by 10 (move decimal left one place)
- 5% = half of 10%
- 1% = divide by 100
- Build complex percentages from simple ones (15% = 10% + 5%)

Application:
To find 35% of 80:
- 10% of 80 = 8
- 30% = 3 × 8 = 24
- 5% = 4
- 35% = 24 + 4 = 28

H3: Multiplication Tricks

Multiplying by 5:
Multiply by 10, then divide by 2
Example: 76 × 5 = (76 × 10) ÷ 2 = 760 ÷ 2 = 380

Multiplying by 25:
Multiply by 100, then divide by 4
Example: 32 × 25 = (32 × 100) ÷ 4 = 3200 ÷ 4 = 800

Close to Round Numbers:
For 18 × 7, use (20 × 7) - (2 × 7) = 140 - 14 = 126

H3: Estimation Skills

When to Estimate:
- Initial check of reasonableness
- Eliminating obviously wrong answers
- Verifying final calculation
- When precise calculation is time-prohibitive

Rounding Strategy:
Round to numbers easy to calculate mentally, but track whether you've rounded up or down to adjust final estimate appropriately.


TIME MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES

Effective timing separates strong mathematical ability from high scores.

H3: Question Triage System

First Pass Strategy:
Quickly scan questions, categorising as:
- Quick (solve immediately - 30-45 seconds)
- Medium (standard difficulty - 60-90 seconds)
- Complex (multi-step or calculation-heavy - 2+ minutes)

Answer quick and medium questions first, marking complex ones for return if time permits.

H3: The 90-Second Rule

Application:
If a question hasn't yielded to solution approach after 90 seconds, make your best guess, mark it clearly, and move forward. Spending 3-4 minutes on a single question sacrifices opportunities to answer easier questions later.

Psychology:
Many "impossible" questions become clearer when you return with fresh perspective after completing other problems.

H3: Using Answer Options Strategically

Work Backwards:
For complex problems, test answer options rather than solving from scratch. Substitute each option and identify which satisfies the problem conditions.

Eliminate and Estimate:
Often you can eliminate 2-3 options through estimation or logical impossibility, improving guessing odds significantly.


COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

Understanding typical errors helps prevent them.

H3: Calculation Errors

Most Frequent:
- Sign errors in operations
- Misalignment in multi-digit arithmetic
- Incorrect order of operations
- Decimal point placement mistakes

Prevention:
- Write calculations clearly in margins when permitted
- Estimate expected answer first
- Double-check decimal placement

H3: Misreading Questions

Error:
Solving for wrong quantity or missing question requirement

Prevention:
- Read final question line carefully
- Note key words like "NOT," "EXCEPT," "approximate"
- Verify your answer matches what's requested

H3: Overcomplicating Problems

Error:
Applying sophisticated approaches to questions with simple solutions

Prevention:
Look for simple, direct solution paths first. The test assesses reasoning, not advanced mathematical techniques.

H3: Ignoring Units

Error:
Calculation correct but units wrong (centimetres instead of metres, dollars instead of cents)

Prevention:
Note units in question and verify answer uses correct units. Quick unit conversion check prevents easily avoided mistakes.


PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS

Effective practice builds both skill and strategy.

H3: Skill Development Focus

Priority Areas:
- Mental arithmetic fluency (fractions, percentages, basic operations)
- Pattern recognition practice
- Word problem translation skills
- Formula application speed

Practice Approach:
Daily 15-20 minute focused practice on specific skills builds fluency more effectively than occasional longer sessions.

H3: Strategic Practice

Apply Techniques:
- Timed practice enforcing 90-second rule
- Answer option testing rather than always solving from scratch
- Estimation before calculation
- Question triage categorisation

Simulated Conditions:
Regular full-section practice under time pressure (35-40 minutes, 30-35 questions, no calculator) builds stamina and realistic timing sense.

H3: Review and Analysis

Learn from Mistakes:
For every incorrect answer, identify why:
- Calculation error? Practice that operation type
- Misunderstood concept? Review that content area
- Time pressure? Implement better triage
- Misread question? Slow down question reading

Analytics Value:
Track performance by content area (number, algebra, geometry, data) to identify exactly where focused study provides maximum improvement.
