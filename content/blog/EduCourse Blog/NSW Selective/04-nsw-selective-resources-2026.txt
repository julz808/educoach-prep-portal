ARTICLE TITLE:
Best NSW Selective Test Prep Resources 2026: Expert Review

INTRODUCTION:

The NSW Selective High Schools Test preparation market offers extensive resources—official Department of Education materials, commercial workbooks, online platforms, tutoring centres, and free resources—each claiming to provide effective preparation. With families investing significant time and money into preparation, understanding which resources deliver genuine value becomes crucial.

The most effective preparation combines authentic question types reflecting actual test format, comprehensive coverage across Reading, Mathematical Reasoning, and Thinking Skills, sufficient practice volume to build confidence, and performance feedback revealing strengths and gaps. Resources providing only some of these elements leave preparation incomplete.

This comprehensive review evaluates the best NSW Selective preparation resources available for 2026, providing honest assessments of official materials, popular commercial products, online platforms, tutoring options, and free resources—helping families make informed decisions across all budget levels.

RESOURCE COMBINATION STRATEGIES

Most effective preparation combines multiple resource types strategically.

H3: Recommended Combinations by Budget

**Comprehensive Preparation (Budget: $200-500)**:

- Excel and James An workbooks ($60-80 total)

- Library-borrowed workbooks (free)
- YouTube educational content (free)
- Excel workbook ($35) if budget allows

H3: Resource Timing Recommendations

**4+ Months Before Test**:
Start with diagnostic using official samples or platform assessment. Use workbooks and comprehensive platforms for skill building.

**2-3 Months Before Test**:
Increase practice volume. Begin full-length timed practice tests. Use platform analytics or workbook results to identify weak areas.

**4-6 Weeks Before Test**:
Focus on weak areas and timed full-length practice. Reduce new content, emphasise consolidation.

**Final 2 Weeks**:
Light practice only. Final review with official samples for format confirmation. Rest and confidence building.


WHAT TO AVOID

Not all resources provide valuable preparation.

H3: Resources That Don't Help

- **Generic IQ test materials**: Not aligned with NSW Selective format or content
- **Outdated books**: Pre-2020 materials may reflect different test formats
- **International selective test prep**: Australian selective tests differ significantly from overseas equivalents
- **Unverified online resources**: Quality varies wildly

H3: Red Flags

- Resources claiming "guaranteed" placement or specific scores
- Materials without clear authorship or credentials
- Practice questions that seem dramatically easier or harder than official samples
- Resources mixing NSW Selective with completely different test types without differentiation
