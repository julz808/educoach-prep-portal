ARTICLE TITLE:
NSW Selective High Schools Test 2026: Complete Guide

INTRODUCTION:

New South Wales operates Australia's largest selective high school system, with 47 fully selective and 17 partially selective high schools providing academically rigorous public education for high-achieving students. Each year, approximately 15,000+ Year 6 students compete for roughly 4,400 Year 7 selective places—making this one of Australia's most competitive academic pathways.

The NSW Selective High Schools Test determines who receives offers. This standardized assessment measures reading comprehension, mathematical reasoning, and thinking skills—providing fair comparison across students from diverse primary schools with varying academic programs and resources.

Understanding the complete selective entry process—test format, scoring methodology, how placement lists work, school allocation, key dates, and preparation requirements—is essential for families considering this pathway. The system is complex, with fully selective schools, partially selective schools, agricultural high schools, and opportunity classes all using test results differently.

This comprehensive guide explains everything about NSW Selective High Schools for 2026: the selective school system structure, complete test format across all three sections, how scoring and placement works, the offer allocation process, key dates and application timeline, eligibility requirements, and what distinguishes selective schools from comprehensive high schools.


H2: Understanding NSW's Selective School System

NSW's selective education includes multiple pathways and school types.

H3: Fully Selective High Schools (47 Schools)

**What They Are**:
Schools where all students gained entry through the selective test. Admission is entirely merit-based using test scores.

**Key Fully Selective Schools Include**:
- James Ruse Agricultural High School (consistently top-ranked)
- Sydney Girls High School and Sydney Boys High School (prestigious inner-city)
- North Sydney Girls and North Sydney Boys (strong academic tradition)
- Baulkham Hills High School (large selective school)
- Hornsby Girls High School (academically excellent)
- Plus 40+ other fully selective schools across Sydney and regional NSW

**Characteristics**:
- Entirely academically selected cohorts
- Accelerated curriculum and high expectations
- Strong VCE/HSC results
- Competitive academic environment
- Co-curricular programs (debating, music, sport)

H3: Partially Selective High Schools (17 Schools)

**What They Are**:
Comprehensive high schools with selective streams. Most students gain entry through local intake (catchment), while selective stream students enter via the selective test.

**How They Work**:
- Selective stream classes separate from mainstream classes for core subjects
- Shared facilities, co-curricular activities, and pastoral care
- Typically 30-90 selective students per year level
- Located across Sydney providing geographic access

**Advantages**:
- Often closer to home than fully selective options
- Less competitive atmosphere than fully selective schools
- Good outcomes for selective stream students
- Backup local school if selective entry unsuccessful

H3: Agricultural High Schools (4 Schools)

**What They Are**:
Selective boarding schools with agricultural education focus:
- James Ruse Agricultural High School (day school, fully selective)
- Farrer Memorial Agricultural High School (boarding)
- Hurlstone Agricultural High School (day and boarding)
- Yanco Agricultural High School (boarding)

**Characteristics**:
- Selective entry via same test
- Agricultural studies integrated into curriculum
- Boarding facilities (except James Ruse)
- Rural/regional student access

H3: Opportunity Classes (OC) - Year 5/6 Entry

**What They Are**:
Academically selective classes within primary schools for Years 5 and 6, serving as a pathway to selective high schools.

**Relevance**:
- Separate application and test (not the Year 6 selective test)
- OC students often perform well in Year 6 selective testing
- Not required for selective high school entry but provides preparation

H3: Test Scoring

**Raw Scores**:
Number of questions answered correctly in each section (maximum 40 per section).

**Scaled Scores**:
Raw scores are scaled to ensure fairness across different test versions. Scaling accounts for difficulty variations between years.

**Total Score**:
Sum of scaled scores across all three sections (maximum 300).

H3: Placement Score Calculation

**Components**:
- Selective Test Score: 60% weighting
- School Assessment: 40% weighting (based on Year 5 and Year 6 school reports)

**Placement Score**:
Calculated formula combining test performance and school assessment creates a final placement score used for all offers.

H3: How Offers Are Allocated

**Step 1: Preference Listing**
Students list up to three selective schools in order of preference on their application.

**Step 2: Placement List Creation**
All applicants are ranked by placement score from highest to lowest.

**Step 3: Allocation Process**
- Highest placement score students receive offers to their first preference (if places available)
- If first preference full, student considered for second preference
- If all preferences full, student may receive offer to nearest selective school with places
