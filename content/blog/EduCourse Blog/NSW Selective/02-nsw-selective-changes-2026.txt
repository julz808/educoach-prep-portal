ARTICLE TITLE:
NSW Selective 2026: Key Changes to the Entry Test

INTRODUCTION:

The NSW Department of Education periodically updates the Selective High Schools Test to ensure it effectively assesses student abilities and aligns with current educational priorities. Understanding what's changed for 2026 helps families prepare appropriately and avoid practicing with outdated information or strategies.

While the core test structure remains consistent—Reading, Mathematical Reasoning, and Thinking Skills sections—modifications to timing, question formats, scoring approaches, or test administration can significantly impact preparation strategies and expected outcomes.

This comprehensive guide details all confirmed 2026 changes to the NSW Selective Entry Test, comparing previous formats, explaining implications for preparation, and providing updated recommendations for families navigating the 2026 application cycle.


CONFIRMED FORMAT CHANGES FOR 2026

Understanding specific test modifications ensures preparation aligns with actual 2026 requirements.

The Department of Education has confirmed that the core three-section format continues unchanged for 2026, providing continuity for families and schools.

H3: Timing Adjustments

Section Timing:
All three sections remain at 40 minutes each, maintaining the total test duration of 2 hours plus administrative time.

No Timing Modifications:
Unlike some previous years where section timing was adjusted, 2026 sees no changes to time allocations, meaning strategies developed for 2024-2025 tests remain applicable.

H3: Question Format Modifications

Multiple-Choice Consistency:
All three sections continue using multiple-choice format with four answer options per question.

Question Count:
Each section typically contains 35-40 questions, though exact counts may vary slightly between test forms to ensure comparable difficulty levels.


POLICY AND ADMINISTRATION CHANGES

Administrative updates affect application processes and test-day experiences.

H3: Application Timeline Adjustments

Key Dates for 2026:
- Applications open: October 2025

- Test date: Mid-March 2026
- Results released: Late June 2026
- Offers made: Early July 2026

Notable Changes:
Application timelines remain consistent with previous years, though specific dates shift based on the school calendar. Families should verify exact dates on the NSW Department of Education website.

H3: Eligibility Requirements

Year 6 Students:
Students currently in Year 6 (entering Year 7 in 2027) remain the primary eligible group.

Residency Requirements:
NSW residency requirements continue unchanged. Students must be Australian citizens or permanent residents residing in NSW.

Special Consideration:
Provisions for special consideration (medical conditions, disability adjustments) remain available with appropriate documentation submitted by the application deadline.

H3: Test Centre Locations

Expanded Access:
Additional test centres have been confirmed for regional and remote areas, reducing travel requirements for rural families.

Metropolitan Centres:
Major metropolitan test centres remain at established locations, with some schools adding capacity to accommodate growing applicant numbers.


SCORING AND PLACEMENT CHANGES

Understanding scoring modifications affects expectation-setting and strategy.

H3: Placement Score Calculation

Formula Consistency:
The placement score continues combining test performance (50%) with school assessment (50%), maintaining the balanced approach introduced in recent years.

School Assessment Component:
School reports covering English and Mathematics from Years 5 and 6 continue contributing 50% of the final placement score, emphasizing consistent academic performance alongside test results.

H3: Reserved Places Updates

Additional Reserved Places:
Some selective schools have increased reserved places for specific equity categories, including:
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students
- Students from low socioeconomic backgrounds
- Students from underrepresented regions

Standard Entry Places:
The majority of places continue being allocated based on placement scores through the standard merit-based process.

H3: School-Specific Changes

New Schools:
No new fully selective high schools are opening for 2027 entry, though several partially selective schools have adjusted their intake numbers.

Capacity Changes:
Some existing selective schools have modified Year 7 intake numbers based on facility upgrades or demographic changes in their catchment areas.


CURRICULUM ALIGNMENT UPDATES

Test content evolves to reflect current NSW curriculum expectations.

H3: Reading Section Adjustments

Text Complexity:
Reading passages continue reflecting NSW syllabus expectations for Stage 3 (Years 5-6) students, with emphasis on increasingly sophisticated texts preparing students for Stage 4 (Years 7-8) demands.

Question Types:
Reading questions maintain focus on literal comprehension, inference, vocabulary in context, text structure, and author's purpose—skills emphasized in current English curriculum.

H3: Mathematical Reasoning Updates

Content Coverage:
Mathematical Reasoning continues assessing Stage 3 mathematics with emphasis on problem-solving and applying mathematical thinking in novel contexts rather than pure computation.

Syllabus Alignment:
Questions reflect updated NSW Mathematics syllabus content, ensuring alignment with what students learn in regular classrooms.

H3: Thinking Skills Evolution

Reasoning Emphasis:
Thinking Skills questions continue assessing verbal reasoning, numerical patterns, and logical thinking—higher-order skills applicable across curriculum areas.

No Specific Subject Knowledge:
The section maintains its focus on reasoning abilities rather than specific subject content, though questions may use various contexts (words, numbers, shapes) for reasoning tasks.


PREPARATION IMPLICATIONS

Understanding changes helps families adjust preparation strategies appropriately.

H3: Practice Materials Updates

Outdated Resources:
Preparation materials published before 2024 may not fully reflect current test formats. Families should verify resources align with the three-section structure implemented in recent years.

Official Practice Materials:
The NSW Department of Education provides sample questions reflecting current test format. These should form the foundation of authentic practice.

H3: Study Focus Areas

Unchanged Priorities:
Core preparation strategies remain consistent:
- Reading widely across diverse text types
- Mathematical problem-solving practice
- Reasoning skills development (verbal and numerical patterns)
- Time management under test conditions

Refined Approaches:
While content areas remain stable, understanding that 2026 maintains recent formatting means families can confidently use 2024-2025 practice strategies without concerns about outdated approaches.


REGIONAL AND EQUITY CHANGES

Access and fairness initiatives continue evolving.

H3: Rural and Remote Access

Additional Support:
Regional families benefit from expanded test centre locations and continued access to online preparation resources provided by the Department.

Travel Burden Reduction:
New test centre locations in regional areas reduce travel requirements for families outside metropolitan Sydney.

H3: Equity Initiatives

Reserved Places Expansion:
Increased reserved places for specific equity groups aim to improve diversity in selective schools while maintaining academic standards.

Application Support:
The Department provides enhanced information sessions and application support for families from non-English speaking backgrounds and those unfamiliar with the selective schools system.


WHAT HASN'T CHANGED

Recognizing continuity helps maintain perspective and confidence.

H3: Core Assessment Principles

Academic Merit:
The test continues measuring academic potential and readiness for accelerated learning environments, maintaining selective schools' foundational purpose.

Fair Assessment:
Multiple-choice format ensures objective scoring free from assessor bias, providing fair evaluation across all candidates.

H3: School Quality Standards

Excellence Focus:
Selective high schools maintain their commitment to academic excellence, advanced curriculum, and support for high-achieving students.

PLANNING FOR 2026 SUCCESS

Understanding changes helps families develop effective preparation timelines.

H3: When to Start Preparing

Recommended Timeline:
Begin focused preparation 4-6 months before the March test (October-November 2025 start recommended).

Earlier Preparation:
Students beginning in Year 5 can focus on fundamental skills (reading widely, mathematical problem-solving) without intensive test-specific practice.

H3: Resource Selection

Current Materials:
Choose preparation resources explicitly updated for 2024-2026 test formats to ensure alignment with three-section structure.

Avoid Outdated Materials:
Books or resources from 2020 or earlier may reflect different test formats and should be used cautiously if at all.

H3: Balancing Test Prep and School Work

Consistent Performance:
Remember that school assessments contribute 50% of placement scores. Strong test performance cannot fully compensate for weak school reports.

Holistic Approach:
Maintain excellent school performance while adding strategic test preparation, rather than sacrificing one for the other.


COMMON MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT CHANGES

Clarifying misunderstandings helps families focus appropriately.

H3: Myth: "Major Changes Happen Every Year"

Reality:
While minor refinements occur, the current three-section format has remained stable for several years. Most "changes" involve administrative details or incremental adjustments rather than complete overhauls.

H3: Myth: "Only New Materials Work"

Reality:
Resources aligned with 2024-2025 formats remain highly relevant for 2026, given the structural consistency across these years.

H3: Myth: "Changes Make the Test Harder"

Reality:
Updates aim to maintain consistent difficulty and fairness across years, not to increase difficulty. Some changes actually improve access (additional test centres) or fairness (expanded reserved places).
