Strategic Approach:
- These are the quickest questions—complete them efficiently
- Use mental math shortcuts when possible
- Double-check your arithmetic (common error source)
- Verify your answer uses the correct units

Time Allocation: 30-45 seconds per question

H2: Word Problems

What They Ask:
Real-world scenarios requiring mathematical translation and solving.

Example: "Sarah bought 3 notebooks for $4.50 each and 2 pens for $2.25 each. How much change did she receive from $20?"

Strategic Approach:
- Read carefully to identify what the question actually asks
- Underline or note key information (quantities, costs, what to find)
- Translate words into mathematical operations
- Work step-by-step
- Check that your answer makes logical sense

Common word problem types:
- Shopping and money problems
- Distance, speed, and time
- Recipes and proportions
- Age problems and comparisons

Time Allocation: 60-90 seconds per question

H2: Pattern and Sequence Problems

What They Ask:
Identify patterns or rules in number sequences.

Example: "What is the next number in this sequence: 3, 7, 15, 31, ___?"

Strategic Approach:
- Look for common patterns: adding/subtracting constant amounts, multiplying/dividing, or more complex rules
- Test your hypothesis: if you think the pattern is "double and add 1," verify it works for all given numbers
- Consider multiple pattern types: arithmetic sequences, geometric sequences, or rule-based patterns

Common patterns:
- Add/subtract the same number each time
- Multiply/divide by the same number
- Add increasing amounts (add 2, then 4, then 6...)
- Square numbers, cube numbers, or other exponential patterns

Time Allocation: 45-75 seconds per question

H2: Geometry and Spatial Reasoning

What They Ask:
Questions involving shapes, angles, area, perimeter, or volume.

Example: "A rectangle has a perimeter of 24 cm and a length of 8 cm. What is its area?"

Strategic Approach:
- Draw diagrams if not provided (use test booklet margins)
- Label known information on your diagram
- Recall relevant formulas (area, perimeter, volume)
- Work systematically through calculations

Essential formulas to know:
- Perimeter rectangle: 2(length + width)
- Area rectangle: length × width
- Area triangle: ½ × base × height
- Circumference circle: 2πr or πd
- Area circle: πr²
- Volume rectangular prism: length × width × height

Time Allocation: 60-90 seconds per question

H2: Data Interpretation

What They Ask:
Extract information from tables, graphs, or charts.

Example: "According to the bar graph, how many more students chose soccer than basketball?"

Strategic Approach:
- Read the graph title and axis labels carefully
- Identify what information is represented
- Locate the specific data points mentioned in the question
- Perform required calculations
- Double-check you're reading the correct scale/units

Common data formats:
- Bar graphs
- Line graphs
- Pie charts
- Tables
- Pictographs

Time Allocation: 45-75 seconds per question

H2: Logical Reasoning and Problem Solving

What They Ask:
Multi-step problems requiring logical thinking and strategy.

Example: "Tom has twice as many marbles as Jane. Together they have 36 marbles. How many does Tom have?"

Strategic Approach:
- Break complex problems into smaller steps
- Use logical reasoning to eliminate impossible answers
- Consider working backwards from answer choices
- Use simple numbers to test your approach before full calculation

Time Allocation: 75-120 seconds per question (these take longest)


H3: Mental Mathematics Strategies

Without calculator access, efficient mental calculation is essential.

H2: Multiplication Shortcuts

Multiplying by 5:
Multiply by 10, then divide by 2
Example: 34 × 5 = 340 ÷ 2 = 170

Multiplying by 25:
Multiply by 100, then divide by 4
Example: 16 × 25 = 1600 ÷ 4 = 400

Multiplying by 9:
Multiply by 10, then subtract the original number
Example: 37 × 9 = 370 - 37 = 333

Multiplying numbers close to 100:
Use the difference method
Example: 98 × 97 = (100-2)(100-3) = 10000 - 300 - 200 + 6 = 9506
Or simpler: 98 × 97 ≈ 9500 (estimate for multiple choice)

H2: Percentage Shortcuts

10%: Move decimal one place left
Example: 10% of 340 = 34

5%: Find 10%, then halve it
Example: 5% of 340 = 34 ÷ 2 = 17

1%: Move decimal two places left
Example: 1% of 340 = 3.4

25%: Divide by 4
Example: 25% of 340 = 340 ÷ 4 = 85

50%: Divide by 2
Example: 50% of 340 = 170

H2: Fraction Shortcuts

Converting common fractions to decimals (memorise these):
- ½ = 0.5
- ¼ = 0.25
- ¾ = 0.75
- ⅓ ≈ 0.33
- ⅔ ≈ 0.67
- ⅕ = 0.2
- ⅖ = 0.4
- ⅗ = 0.6
- ⅘ = 0.8

H2: Estimation Strategies

When exact calculation is difficult, estimate to eliminate obviously wrong answers:

Round strategically:
- For multiplication, round one number up and one down
- For division, round to numbers that divide easily
- For addition/subtraction, round all numbers to nearest 10 or 100

Example: 47 × 23
Estimate: 50 × 20 = 1000 (so answer should be close to 1000)
Actual: 1081
This eliminates any answer choices like 470, 2350, or other distant values


H3: Problem-Solving Strategies

Beyond computation, effective problem-solving approaches improve performance significantly.

H2: The 4-Step Problem-Solving Process

Step 1: Understand the Question
- What is actually being asked?
- What information is provided?
- What information is missing or irrelevant?

Step 2: Plan Your Approach
- What operation(s) are needed?
- Is there a formula to apply?
- Should you work forwards or backwards?

Step 3: Execute the Solution
- Perform calculations carefully
- Show working in test booklet margins
- Keep track of units

Step 4: Verify Your Answer
- Does your answer make logical sense?
- Is it in the right ballpark (estimation check)?
- Are units correct?

H2: Working Backwards from Answer Choices

For some questions, testing answer choices is faster than solving algebraically.

Example: "What number increased by 15% equals 69?"

Rather than solving algebraically:
Test answer choices:
- If choice is 60: 60 + 9 (15%) = 69 ✓ Correct

This works especially well for:
- "What number..." questions
- Age problems
- Some algebra questions

H2: Elimination Strategy

Use mathematical reasoning to eliminate impossible answers:

Too large/too small:
Quick estimation often eliminates 2-3 obviously incorrect options.

Wrong units or format:
If the question asks for area in cm², eliminate answers in cm or other units.

Doesn't match the question type:
If asking for "how many more," the answer must be a difference, not a total.

H2: Draw Diagrams

Visual representation clarifies many problems:

Geometry problems: Always draw and label diagrams
Word problems: Sketch simple representations of scenarios
Comparison problems: Use bar models or simple drawings to visualise relationships


H3: Time Management Strategies

With 30 questions in 30 minutes, efficient pacing is critical.

H2: Question Difficulty Awareness

Not all questions take equal time:
- Quick computation: 30-45 seconds
- Standard problems: 60 seconds
- Complex multi-step problems: 90-120 seconds

Aim to complete easier questions quickly, banking time for harder ones.

H2: The Two-Pass Strategy

Pass 1 (20 minutes):
Answer questions you can solve confidently and relatively quickly. Skip questions that look time-consuming or confusing.

Pass 2 (8 minutes):
Return to skipped questions and give them your best effort.

Final 2 minutes:
Ensure every question has an answer (guess if necessary—no penalty for wrong answers).

H2: When to Skip and Move On

Skip immediately if:
- You've spent 90+ seconds without progress
- You don't understand what the question asks after two readings
- The calculations seem excessively complex

Mark it, make your best guess, and return if time permits.


H3: Common Mathematical Content Areas

H2: Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages

Key skills:
- Converting between forms (fraction ↔ decimal ↔ percentage)
- Finding percentages of amounts
- Comparing fractions and decimals
- Operations with fractions

Practice focus:
Mixed operations problems requiring format conversion.

H2: Ratio and Proportion

Key skills:
- Understanding ratio notation (3:2)

H2: Basic Algebra

Key skills:
- Solving simple equations (find x)
- Substituting values into formulas
- Understanding variables and expressions
- Number patterns and rules

Note: ACER algebra is basic—you won't encounter complex quadratic equations or advanced concepts.

H2: Measurement and Units

Key skills:
- Converting between units (cm ↔ m, g ↔ kg, mL ↔ L)
- Calculating perimeter and area
- Understanding volume
- Time calculations

Common conversions to memorise:
- 100 cm = 1 m
- 1000 m = 1 km
- 1000 g = 1 kg
- 1000 mL = 1 L
- 60 seconds = 1 minute
- 60 minutes = 1 hour


H3: Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

H2: Mistake 1: Misreading the Question

Many errors come from answering the wrong question.

Example: Question asks "How much change from $20?" but student calculates total spent.

Solution: Underline or mentally note what the question actually asks before calculating.

H2: Mistake 2: Arithmetic Errors

Without calculators, mental math mistakes are common.

Solution:
- Work carefully through each step
- Use estimation to verify answers are reasonable
- Double-check operations (did you add when you should have multiplied?)

H2: Mistake 3: Unit Errors

Calculating correctly but providing the answer in wrong units.

Solution:
- Note what units the question requests
- Convert your answer to those units if necessary
- Check answer choices match expected units

H2: Mistake 4: Over-Complicating

Assuming problems are harder than they are.

Solution:
- Start with the simplest approach
- Check if direct calculation works before trying complex methods
- Remember ACER tests reasoning, not advanced computation

H2: Mistake 5: Not Using Scratch Space

Trying to solve complex problems entirely mentally.

Solution:
Use test booklet margins for:
- Working out calculations
- Drawing diagrams
- Testing answer choices
- Organizing information


H3: Practice Strategies for Maximum Improvement

H2: Build Mental Math Fluency

Daily practice (10-15 minutes):
- Practice multiplication tables (up to 12×12)
- Percentage calculations
- Fraction-decimal-percentage conversions
- Mental addition and subtraction

Use apps, flashcards, or quick mental math warm-ups before study sessions.

H2: Practice Without a Calculator

From the beginning of your ACER preparation, practice ALL mathematics without calculator access. This builds necessary mental math stamina.

H2: Timed Practice

Start with untimed practice to build accuracy, then progressively add time pressure:
- Week 1-2: Untimed focus on accuracy
- Week 3-4: 40 minutes for 30 questions (relaxed timing)
- Week 5+: Strict 30-minute timing

H2: Error Analysis

For every incorrect answer:
- Identify the error type (misread question, calculation error, wrong approach, etc.)
- Rework the problem correctly
- Note the strategy that should have been used
- Practice similar problems to build that skill


H3: Tips from High Performers

Students scoring in the 90th+ percentile share these strategies:

1. "I always estimate the answer before calculating. This catches most of my errors and helps eliminate wrong answers quickly."

2. "For word problems, I underline what the question asks before I start solving. This stops me from calculating the wrong thing."

3. "I practice mental math daily—just 10 minutes with flashcards or apps. This made the no-calculator section much less stressful."

4. "I don't try to do everything in my head. I use the margins to show working, which reduces silly mistakes."

5. "If a question looks really hard, I skip it immediately and come back later. I've learned not to waste 3 minutes on one hard question when I could correctly answer 3 easier ones."
