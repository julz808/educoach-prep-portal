ARTICLE TITLE:
Victoria Selective Entry 2026: Complete Guide for Parents

INTRODUCTION:

Victoria's selective entry high schools represent the state's most academically rigorous public secondary education pathway. Admission is highly competitive, with approximately 5,000+ students competing annually for roughly 1,600 Year 9 places across four government selective schools: Melbourne High School, Mac.Robertson Girls' High School, Nossal High School, and Suzanne Cory High School.

The Selective Entry High School Placement Test determines who receives offers. Unlike school-based assessments that measure curriculum mastery, this standardized test measures reasoning abilities, comprehension skills, and writing capability—providing a fair comparison across students from different primary schools with varying academic programs.

If your child aspires to attend a Victorian selective entry school, understanding the complete process—test format, scoring methodology, how offers are determined, key dates, and preparation requirements—is essential for making informed decisions and developing an effective preparation strategy.

This comprehensive guide explains everything about Victoria's Selective Entry process for 2026: the four selective schools and their characteristics, the complete test format across all four sections, how scoring and placement offers work, key dates and application timeline, eligibility requirements, and what distinguishes this pathway from other secondary school options.

Strong writing can significantly boost overall placement scores.


H2: Scoring and Placement Offers

Understanding how offers are determined clarifies what scores are needed.

H3: Test Scoring

**Section Scores**:
Each section receives a raw score (number correct for multiple choice; rubric score for writing) which is then converted to a scaled score.

**Scaled Scores**:
To ensure fairness across different test versions and years, raw scores are scaled. This allows comparison between students taking different test forms.

**Superior Ability Range**:
The Department of Education defines "superior ability" scores for each section. Students must achieve superior ability in at least three of the four sections to be eligible for offers.

H3: How Offers Are Made

**Step 1: Superior Ability Determination**
Students must demonstrate superior ability in at least 3 of 4 sections to be considered for offers.

**Step 2: Placement Score Calculation**
For eligible students, a placement score is calculated combining:
- Selective Entry test results (majority weighting)
- Primary school results (minority weighting, typically 20-25%)

**Step 3: Preference-Based Allocation**
- Students are ranked by placement score
- Offers are allocated based on student preferences and available places
- Higher placement scores have better chances at first-preference schools
- Students can receive offers to lower-preference schools if first preference is full

**Step 4: Offer Rounds**
- Round 1 offers (majority of places allocated)
- Round 2 offers (remaining places, waitlist movement)

H3: What Scores Are Competitive?

While exact cutoffs aren't published and vary slightly year-to-year:

**Highly Competitive** (strong chance at first-preference school):
- Superior ability in all four sections
- Placement score in top 20-25% of eligible students

**Competitive** (likely offer, possibly second or third preference):
- Superior ability in three sections
- Placement score in top 30-35% of eligible students

**Borderline** (possible offer in later rounds):
- Superior ability in exactly three sections
- Placement score just meeting threshold

Approximately 32-35% of test-takers receive offers across the four schools.
