# ðŸ“Š Insights Section - Demo Mode

## Overview
The Insights section now includes comprehensive mock data across all four tabs so you can see exactly how the analytics will look with realistic student performance data.

## Mock Data Configuration

### Switching Between Mock and Real Data
In `src/services/analyticsService.ts`, line 14:
```typescript
// MOCK DATA MODE: Set to false to use real database queries
const USE_MOCK_DATA = true;

## How It Looks

When you navigate to the Insights section, you'll see:

1. **Exact design match** to your provided screenshots
2. **Professional styling** with proper spacing and typography
3. **Interactive elements** with hover states and animations
4. **Clean organization** that's easy to scan and understand

## Next Steps

To switch back to real database queries when you have actual user data:
1. Set `USE_MOCK_DATA = false` in `analyticsService.ts`
2. Ensure your database has the required user progress data
3. The service will automatically fetch real performance analytics

The mock data provides a complete preview of how the insights will function with actual student performance data once users begin taking tests and completing drills.
