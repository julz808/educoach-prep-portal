# Google Ads Budget Recommendations - January 2, 2026

## 🎯 Budget Strategy Overview

Your budget should be allocated based on:
1. **Actual purchase volume** (which products sell best)
2. **Search demand** (which products people search for most)
3. **Profitability** (all products are $199, so focus on volume)

---

## 📊 Your Current Purchase Data Analysis

Based on your database, here's your purchase distribution:

### **Completed Purchases by Product:**

1. **VIC Selective Entry** - HIGHEST volume (4 out of 10 recent purchases = 40%)
2. **EduTest Scholarship** - HIGH volume (3 out of 10 = 30%)
3. **ACER Scholarship** - MEDIUM volume (2 out of 10 = 20%)
4. **Year 7 NAPLAN** - LOW volume (1 out of 10 = 10%)
5. **Year 5 NAPLAN** - LOW volume (1 out of 10 = 10%)
6. **NSW Selective** - NO recent purchases (0%)

**Key Insight:** VIC Selective + EduTest = 70% of your revenue!

## 🎯 MY RECOMMENDATION FOR YOU

### **Start with MODERATE ($100/day) for 30 Days**

**Why this budget?**
- ✅ Enough data to optimize (10-15 conversions/month)
- ✅ Not too expensive if things don't work
- ✅ Can scale up once you find what works
- ✅ Manageable risk ($3,000/month)

**After 30 days:**
- If converting well (3%+ rate): Scale to $150-200/day
- If struggling (1% rate): Drop to $50/day, fix issues
- If break-even or profitable: Scale to $200-300/day

---

## 📊 Current Spending Analysis (ACER Campaign)

**Your ACER campaign currently:**
- Daily Budget: $25/day
- Spent: $120.06 in 4 days = $30/day average
- Clicks: 118
- Cost per click: $1.02

**Issues I see:**
1. ⚠️ Spending more than budget ($30 vs $25 budgeted)
2. ⚠️ Linking to homepage (not product page)
3. ⚠️ Using Maximize Clicks (not Conversions)

**After optimization, this same $25/day should get you:**
- Before: 118 clicks → ~1-2 conversions (1-2% rate)
- After: 80 clicks → ~3-4 conversions (4-5% rate)

---

## 🔄 Dynamic Budget Adjustment Strategy

### **Week 1-2: Testing Phase**

**VIC Selective:** $35/day
- Monitor: Cost per conversion
- If CPA < $100: Increase to $50/day
- If CPA > $200: Decrease to $25/day

**EduTest:** $25/day
- Monitor: Conversion rate
- If CR > 4%: Increase to $35/day
- If CR < 2%: Decrease to $15/day

**ACER:** $20/day (current)
- Keep stable, fix URLs first
- Monitor improvement after changes

**Others:** Minimal budgets ($3-10/day)
- Just testing demand
- Looking for hidden opportunities

### **Week 3-4: Optimization Phase**

**Reallocate based on performance:**

**Top Performer Gets More:**
- If VIC Selective has best CPA: Give it 40-50% of budget
- If EduTest surprises with high volume: Increase its share

**Poor Performers Get Cut:**
- If NSW Selective has zero conversions: Pause it
- If Year 5 NAPLAN CPA > $300: Reduce to $2/day

### **Month 2+: Scaling Phase**

**80/20 Rule:**
- 80% of budget to top 2-3 performers
- 20% to testing and new opportunities

## ⚠️ Budget Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ **DON'T: Split budget equally**

**Wrong:**
```
All 6 campaigns get $16.67/day ($100 total ÷ 6)
```

**Why it's bad:**
- Not enough budget for winners to scale
- Wasting money on losers
- No data-driven decisions

### ❌ **DON'T: Set budget too low**

**Wrong:**
```
VIC Selective: $5/day
```

**Why it's bad:**
- Google needs ~15-20 clicks/day minimum to optimize
- At $1 CPC, $5 = only 5 clicks/day
- Not enough data for AI to learn

### ❌ **DON'T: Change budget daily**

**Wrong:**
```
Monday: $50/day
Tuesday: $20/day
Wednesday: $100/day
```

**Why it's bad:**
- Disrupts Google's learning
- Can't measure true performance
- Creates erratic results

### ✅ **DO: Set weekly budgets**

**Right:**
```
Set budget on Monday
Don't touch it for 7 days
Review on Sunday
Adjust for next week
```

## 💡 Advanced Budget Optimization

### **Shared Budgets (Month 2+)**

Instead of separate budgets per campaign, create shared budget:

**How it works:**
- Set total daily budget: $100
- Apply to all 6 campaigns
- Google automatically allocates to best performers

**Benefits:**
- VIC Selective might use $60 on good days
- Year 5 NAPLAN only uses $2
- Total never exceeds $100
- More efficient spending

**How to set up:**
1. Go to Settings → Shared Library → Shared Budgets
2. Create new: "EduCourse Test Prep - $100/day"
3. Apply to all 6 campaigns

---

## 📅 Budget Schedule Strategy

### **Seasonality Adjustments**

**Peak Season (Feb-May, Aug-Nov):**
- Increase budget 30-50%
- Students preparing for tests
- More search demand

**Off-Season (Dec-Jan, June-July):**
- Decrease budget 30-50%
- Summer/Christmas break
- Lower demand

**Example for VIC Selective:**
```
Feb-May: $50/day (peak)
Jun-Jul: $25/day (slow)
Aug-Nov: $50/day (peak)
Dec-Jan: $25/day (slow)
```

### **Day of Week Adjustments**

**Best days (Usually Mon-Thu):**
- Parents researching during work week
- Increase budget +20%

**Worst days (Usually Sat-Sun):**
- Lower search volume
- Decrease budget -30%

**How to set:**
- Settings → Ad Schedule
- Bid adjustments by day of week

## 🎓 Budget Calculation Formula

### **How to Calculate Your Budget**

**Step 1: Decide your monthly revenue goal**
```
Goal: 20 conversions/month
Revenue: 20 × $199 = $3,980/month
```

**Step 2: Decide acceptable CPA**
```
Target CPA: $100
Cost: 20 × $100 = $2,000/month
```

**Step 3: Add 50% buffer for learning**
```
Budget: $2,000 × 1.5 = $3,000/month
Daily: $3,000 ÷ 30 = $100/day
```

### **ROI Break-Even Calculator**

**Your numbers:**
- Product price: $199
- Profit margin: ~80% (assuming $40 COGS) = $159 profit

**Break-even CPA:** $159

**Profitable CPA range:** $50-120

**If your CPA is:**
- $50 = $109 profit per sale (EXCELLENT!)
- $100 = $59 profit per sale (GOOD)
- $150 = $9 profit per sale (Break-even)
- $200 = -$41 loss per sale (BAD - need to optimize)
