# Stripe Integration Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform EduCourse from a free-access platform to a product-based payment system where users purchase individual access to each of the 6 test products at AUD $199 each.

## Current Infrastructure Context
- **Existing Stripe Account**: Ready for integration
- **EduCourse Domain**: Available for production deployment
- **Current WordPress/Elementor Landing Page**: To be replaced with this platform
- **Current Thinkific Platform**: To be replaced with this custom platform
- **Migration Strategy**: Seamless transition from Thinkific to custom platform

## Current State Analysis

### ✅ Existing Infrastructure (Ready)
- **Database Schema**: `user_products` table with Stripe integration fields
- **Access Control Service**: Complete `userMetadataService.ts` with access control functions
- **RLS Policies**: Proper row-level security for all user data
- **Product Architecture**: Clean separation with per-product progress tracking
- **Mock Payment UI**: Landing page with "Buy Now" buttons ready for integration

### ❌ Implementation Gaps (Need Implementation)
- **No Access Control Enforcement**: Users can access all products for free
- **No Paywall UI**: No restrictions shown in interface
- **No Stripe Integration**: Payment buttons are placeholder only
- **No Webhook Handling**: No automated access granting after payment

## Product Pricing Structure

All 6 products priced at **AUD $199** each:

1. **VIC Selective Entry (Year 9 Entry)** - $199 AUD
2. **NSW Selective Entry (Year 7 Entry)** - $199 AUD  
3. **Year 5 NAPLAN** - $199 AUD
4. **Year 7 NAPLAN** - $199 AUD
5. **EduTest Scholarship (Year 7 Entry)** - $199 AUD
6. **ACER Scholarship (Year 7 Entry)** - $199 AUD

## Implementation Strategy

### Core Principle: **NON-BREAKING IMPLEMENTATION**
- ✅ Preserve all existing functionality
- ✅ Maintain current user experience for paid users
- ✅ Keep all existing features working
- ✅ Gradual rollout with safety checks

### Phase 1: Access Control Foundation (SAFE)
1. **Update ProductContext** with access control checks
2. **Add access validation** without breaking existing flows
3. **Create fallback behavior** for users without access
4. **Implement graceful degradation** if access service fails

### Phase 2: Paywall UI Components (ADDITIVE)
1. **Create PaywallComponent** for restricted access
2. **Add purchase prompts** in dashboard
3. **Show locked state indicators** in navigation
4. **Implement trial/preview modes** for upselling

### Phase 3: Stripe Integration (EXTERNAL)
1. **Configure Stripe products** with AUD $199 pricing
2. **Set up Stripe Checkout** integration
3. **Create webhook handlers** for payment processing
4. **Implement success/failure flows**

### Phase 4: User Experience Enhancements (POLISH)
1. **Add purchase history** page
2. **Implement account management** features
3. **Create upgrade prompts** and upselling
4. **Add customer support** integration

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Integration
```sql
-- Existing user_products table structure (NO CHANGES NEEDED)
user_products (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  product_type text NOT NULL,
  is_active boolean DEFAULT true,
  stripe_subscription_id text,
  purchased_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now()
);
```

### Access Control Flow
```typescript
// Safe access control check with fallback
const checkProductAccess = async (userId: string, productType: string) => {
  try {
    const hasAccess = await hasProductAccess(userId, productType);
    return hasAccess;
  } catch (error) {
    // Graceful fallback - allow access if service fails
    console.warn('Access check failed, allowing access:', error);
    return true;
  }
};
```

### Stripe Product Mapping
```typescript
const STRIPE_PRODUCTS = {
  'VIC Selective Entry (Year 9 Entry)': {
    priceId: 'price_vic_selective_aud_199',
    name: 'VIC Selective Entry',
    price: 199,
    currency: 'AUD'
  },
  'NSW Selective Entry (Year 7 Entry)': {
    priceId: 'price_nsw_selective_aud_199', 
    name: 'NSW Selective Entry',
    price: 199,
    currency: 'AUD'
  },
  // ... etc for all 6 products
};
```

## Safety Measures

### 1. Gradual Rollout
- **Feature Flags**: Environment variables to enable/disable access control
- **Admin Override**: Special admin accounts that bypass restrictions
- **Fallback Behavior**: Default to allowing access if anything fails

### 2. Data Protection
- **No Data Migration**: Use existing database structure
- **Preserve User Progress**: All existing user data remains intact
- **Backup Strategy**: Database backups before major changes

### 3. User Experience Protection
- **Existing Users**: Users who already have progress get free access
- **Graceful Degradation**: If payment system fails, show clear messaging
- **Support Integration**: Clear help and contact options for payment issues

### 4. Testing Strategy
- **Test Mode First**: All Stripe integration in test mode initially
- **Staging Environment**: Full testing before production deployment
- **Rollback Plan**: Ability to quickly disable access control if needed

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Foundation (Safe Implementation)
- [ ] Update ProductContext with access control (with fallbacks)
- [ ] Create PaywallComponent (without enforcing restrictions yet)
- [ ] Add environment flags for gradual rollout
- [ ] Test all existing functionality remains intact

### Week 2: UI Integration (Additive Features)
- [ ] Integrate paywall components into dashboard
- [ ] Add purchase prompts and locked state indicators
- [ ] Update course pricing display to AUD $199
- [ ] Create purchase history page structure

### Week 3: Stripe Integration (External Services)
- [ ] Set up Stripe products and pricing
- [ ] Implement Stripe Checkout integration
- [ ] Create Supabase Edge Function for webhooks
- [ ] Test payment flow end-to-end in test mode

### Week 4: Production Rollout (Careful Deployment)
- [ ] Enable access control for new users only
- [ ] Gradually roll out to existing users
- [ ] Monitor system stability and user feedback
- [ ] Full production launch with monitoring

## Environment Variables Needed

```env
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Feature Flags
ENABLE_ACCESS_CONTROL=false  # Start disabled
ENABLE_PAYWALL_UI=false      # Start disabled
STRIPE_MODE=test            # Start in test mode
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Conversion Rate**: Landing page visits to purchases
- **User Retention**: How access control affects user engagement
- **Payment Success Rate**: Stripe checkout completion rate
- **Support Tickets**: Payment-related customer issues

### Error Monitoring
- **Access Control Failures**: When access checks fail
- **Payment Processing Errors**: Stripe webhook failures
- **Database Issues**: User access table problems
- **UI Errors**: Paywall component rendering issues

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Access control system working with fallbacks
- ✅ No user complaints about broken features
- ✅ Clean implementation with proper error handling

### Phase 2 Success
