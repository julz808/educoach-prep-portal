# Phase 1 Simplified Approach

## üö® **Current Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Email Verification 404 Error**
**Problem**: After email verification, you're redirected to `educourseportal.vercel.app/dashboard` which shows 404
**Solution**: The DashboardRedirect component already exists and should handle this

### **Issue 2: Product Access Not Working**
**Problem**: After purchase, the product is still behind paywall
**Possible Causes**:
1. Webhook isn't processing correctly
2. User ID mismatch between guest checkout and actual user
3. Product type mapping issue

### **Issue 3: Complex Subdomain Routing**
**Problem**: The subdomain routing is making development/testing complicated
**Solution**: For now, keep everything on one domain until ready for production split

## üéØ **Immediate Fixes Needed**

### **1. Check Webhook Logs**
Go to your Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Click on your webhook ‚Üí View attempts
- Look for any failed webhook attempts
- Check the response from your webhook

### **2. Verify Product Mapping**
Check that your Stripe product IDs match what's in the webhook:

```typescript
// In stripe-webhook/index.ts
const STRIPE_PRODUCT_TO_DB_TYPE: Record<string, string> = {
  // Make sure these product IDs match your actual Stripe products
  'prod_Shqo1r4nLXrZ1O': 'Year 5 NAPLAN',
  'prod_ShqppA31VnjzIP': 'Year 7 NAPLAN', 
  // ... etc
};
```

### **3. Check Database for Product Access**
Run this SQL query in Supabase:
```sql
-- Check if user_products records are being created
SELECT 
  up.*,
  p.email
FROM user_products up
JOIN profiles p ON p.id = up.user_id
WHERE p.email = 'YOUR_TEST_EMAIL'
ORDER BY up.created_at DESC;
```

## üîß **Simplified Deployment Strategy**

### **Option A: Single Domain (Recommended for Now)**

Keep everything on `educourseportal.vercel.app`:
- `/` - Homepage
- `/auth` - Authentication  
- `/dashboard` - Learning platform
- `/course/*` - Course pages

**Benefits**:
- Simpler to debug
- No cross-domain issues
- Easier user experience

### **Option B: Manual Subdomain Later**

Once everything works on single domain:
1. Deploy learning platform to `learning-educourse.vercel.app`
2. Set up proper redirects
3. Configure cross-domain authentication

## üìù **Debugging Checklist**

### **Test Purchase Flow**
1. [ ] Go to incognito/private browser window
2. [ ] Purchase a product as guest
3. [ ] Check Stripe Dashboard - payment successful?
4. [ ] Check Stripe Webhook logs - webhook processed?
5. [ ] Check Supabase logs - user created?
6. [ ] Check user_products table - access granted?

### **Check These Tables in Supabase**
```sql
-- 1. Check if user was created
SELECT * FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- 2. Check if profile was created
SELECT * FROM profiles WHERE email = 'test@example.com';

-- 3. Check if product access was granted
SELECT * FROM user_products WHERE user_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'test@example.com'
);

-- 4. Check for any pending purchases
SELECT * FROM pending_purchases WHERE email = 'test@example.com';
```

## üöÄ **Quick Fix for Product Access**

If webhook isn't working, manually grant access for testing:

```sql
-- Manual product access grant (replace with actual values)
INSERT INTO user_products (
  user_id,
  product_type,
  is_active,
  purchased_at
) VALUES (
  'USER_UUID_HERE',
  'Year 5 NAPLAN', -- or whatever product
  true,
  NOW()
);
```

## üéØ **Recommended Next Steps**

1. **Fix immediate issues** on single domain deployment
2. **Get purchase flow working** end-to-end
3. **Test with real users** 
4. **Then consider subdomain split** once everything is stable

## üí° **Development Testing**

For local testing, just use single port:
```bash
npm run dev  # Everything on localhost:3000
```

Test these flows:
1. Guest purchase ‚Üí Auto account creation ‚Üí Product access
2. Existing user login ‚Üí Purchase ‚Üí Product access  
3. Email verification ‚Üí Dashboard access

Once these work locally and on Vercel, then we can implement the subdomain split properly.
