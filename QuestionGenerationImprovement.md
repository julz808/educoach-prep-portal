# Question Generation System Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

The current question generation system suffers from critical issues that undermine assessment validity and educational value:

1. **Duplicate Questions**: Same questions appear across different test modes (practice tests 1-5, diagnostic, drills)
2. **Multiple Correct Answers**: Questions with ambiguous or multiple defensible answers across all subjects
3. **Poor Educational Value**: Basic explanations lack actionable learning strategies
4. **Inadequate Validation**: Limited quality control allows problematic questions to reach students

This document outlines a comprehensive overhaul to create a robust, cost-effective system that generates unique, unambiguous questions with high educational value.

## Problem Analysis

### 1. Question Duplication Crisis

**Current Architecture Issue:**
- Each test mode (practice_1, practice_2, practice_3, practice_4, practice_5, drill, diagnostic) is generated independently
- No awareness of previously generated content across test modes
- `GenerationContext` resets for each generation session
- Same topics, scenarios, and approaches repeated across tests

**Impact:**
- Students encounter identical questions in different test modes
- Undermines assessment validity and learning progression
- Creates unfair advantages for students who take multiple practice tests
- Reduces content variety and engagement

**Evidence:**
- Observed in EduTest Scholarship Verbal Reasoning across practice tests 1-3
- Similar patterns likely exist in other products and sections

### 2. Multiple Correct Answer Problem

**Scope:**
- **Mathematics**: Calculation errors, ambiguous word problems, multiple valid approaches
- **Verbal Reasoning**: Analogies with multiple valid relationships, logic questions with unclear premises
- **Reading Comprehension**: Inference questions with multiple reasonable conclusions, subjective interpretation questions
- **Language Conventions**: Grammar rules with acceptable variations, style vs. correctness conflicts

**Current Validation Gaps:**
- Focus on structural validation (format, required fields)
- Basic mathematics checking only
- No cross-answer analysis for ambiguity
- No subject-matter expertise validation

**Cost of Problem:**
- Invalid assessment results
- Student frustration and loss of confidence
- Undermines platform credibility
- Requires expensive manual review and correction

### 3. Limited Educational Value

**Current Solution Format:**
```
"Here's why B is correct: [basic explanation]"
```

**Missing Elements:**
- No explanation of why wrong answers are wrong
- No actionable strategies for similar questions
- No skill transfer to future problems
- Limited meta-cognitive development

**Educational Impact:**
- Students learn answers but not problem-solving strategies
- Missed opportunities for skill development
- Reduced value proposition vs. competitors
- Lower student engagement and retention

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Unified Section Generation System

**New Architecture:**
Instead of generating test modes separately, generate ALL questions for a section across ALL test modes in a single unified batch.

**Generation Flow:**
```
Section: "Verbal Reasoning" 
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Calculate total questions needed across all modes:
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Practice Test 1: 15 questions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Practice Test 2: 15 questions  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Practice Test 3: 15 questions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Practice Test 4: 15 questions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Practice Test 5: 15 questions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Diagnostic: 18 questions (6 sub-skills √ó 3 difficulties)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Drills: 90 questions (3 sub-skills √ó 30 questions each)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Total: 183 unique questions needed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Generate with unified diversity tracking
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Distribute across test modes ensuring no duplicates
```

**Benefits:**
- Guaranteed unique questions across all test modes
- Unified diversity tracking (topics, scenarios, names, locations)
- Efficient generation with shared context
- Consistent quality standards across all test modes

### 2. Enhanced Single-Call Prevention

**Cost-Effective Approach:**
No secondary Claude calls - all quality control built into enhanced prompt engineering that prevents problems at the source.

**Prevention Components:**

#### A. Advanced Distractor Generation Prompting
```
üéØ DISTRACTOR QUALITY MANDATE:
For each wrong answer option, you MUST ensure it is:
1. ‚úÖ Plausible enough that a student might reasonably choose it
2. ‚úÖ Definitively wrong - cannot be defended as correct under any interpretation
3. ‚úÖ Based on common student errors, misconceptions, or logical mistakes
4. ‚úÖ Clear and unambiguous in its incorrectness

üö´ FORBIDDEN DISTRACTOR TYPES:
- Answers that could be correct under different interpretations
- Options that are "technically correct" in some contexts
- Mathematical results from reasonable alternative methods
- Partial answers that are "somewhat correct"

üîç MANDATORY SELF-CHECK:
"Could a knowledgeable teacher defend this answer as potentially correct?"
If YES: Revise that distractor until it's clearly wrong but still plausible.
```

#### B. Built-in Self-Validation Requirements
```
FINAL QUALITY CONTROL - MANDATORY SELF-VERIFICATION:
üîç ANSWER UNIQUENESS CHECK:
‚úÖ EXACTLY ONE CORRECT ANSWER: Verify only one option is definitively correct
‚úÖ DISTRACTOR VERIFICATION: Confirm each wrong answer cannot be defended as correct
‚úÖ NO AMBIGUITY: Question has only one reasonable interpretation

üîç MATHEMATICAL/LOGICAL ACCURACY CHECK:
‚úÖ CALCULATION VERIFICATION: Double-check all work step-by-step
‚úÖ LOGICAL CONSISTENCY: Answer follows logically from given information
```

#### C. Subject-Specific Error Prevention
```
HIGH-QUALITY DISTRACTOR STRATEGIES BY SUBJECT:
- Mathematics: Common calculation errors, wrong formulas, reversed operations
- Reading: Details from wrong text sections, unsupported inferences
- Verbal Reasoning: Logical-sounding but incorrect relationships
- Language: Rules that apply elsewhere but not in this context
```

#### D. Educational Solution Structure Enforcement
```
ENHANCED SOLUTION FORMAT - MANDATORY STRUCTURE:
**Correct Answer: [Letter]**
**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
**Tips for Similar Questions:**
```

### 3. Enhanced Educational Solution Format

**New Structured Format:**
```markdown
**Correct Answer: B**
[Brief, clear explanation of why B is correct]

**Why Other Options Are Wrong:**
- A: [Specific flaw or error in reasoning]
- C: [Specific flaw or error in reasoning]  
- D: [Specific flaw or error in reasoning]

**Tips for Similar Questions:**
‚Ä¢ [Strategy/technique 1 - specific, actionable]
‚Ä¢ [Pattern recognition tip - transferable skill]
‚Ä¢ [Common mistake to avoid - error prevention]
```

**Subject-Specific Tip Categories:**

**Verbal Reasoning:**
- Relationship identification techniques
- Analogy pattern recognition
- Logical reasoning frameworks
- Common fallacy avoidance

**Reading Comprehension:**
- Text scanning strategies
- Inference vs. fact differentiation
- Evidence location techniques
- Author intent analysis

**Mathematics:**
- Problem-solving frameworks
- Calculation verification methods
- Visual representation techniques
- Error checking strategies

**Language Conventions:**
- Grammar rule mnemonics
- Punctuation decision trees
- Common error patterns
- Quick verification checks

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Enhanced Single-Call Generation with Prevention-First Quality Control (2-3 days)

#### Step 1.1: Redesign Claude Prompts with Advanced Distractor Prevention
**File:** `/src/engines/questionGeneration/claudePrompts.ts`

**Changes Required:**
1. Add explicit distractor quality mandates to prevent multiple correct answers at source
2. Include mandatory self-check questions within Claude prompts
3. Add subject-specific distractor quality strategies  
4. Include structured solution format requirements with educational tips

**Example Enhanced Distractor Prevention:**
```typescript
const DISTRACTOR_QUALITY_MANDATE = `
üéØ DISTRACTOR QUALITY MANDATE - CRITICAL FOR VALID ASSESSMENT:
For each wrong answer option, you MUST ensure it is:
1. ‚úÖ Plausible enough that a student might reasonably choose it
2. ‚úÖ Definitively wrong - cannot be defended as correct under any interpretation
3. ‚úÖ Based on common student errors, misconceptions, or logical mistakes
4. ‚úÖ Clear and unambiguous in its incorrectness

üö´ FORBIDDEN DISTRACTOR TYPES - NEVER CREATE THESE:
- Answers that could be correct under different interpretations
- Options that are "technically correct" in some contexts
- Mathematical results from reasonable alternative methods
- Partial answers that are "somewhat correct"

üîç MANDATORY SELF-CHECK BEFORE FINALIZING:
"Could a knowledgeable teacher defend this answer as potentially correct?"
If YES: Revise that distractor until it's clearly wrong but still plausible.
`;
```

#### Step 1.2: Implement Subject-Specific Tip Libraries
**File:** `/src/engines/questionGeneration/educationalTips.ts` (new)

**Create tip frameworks for each domain:**
```typescript
export const VERBAL_REASONING_TIPS = {
  analogies: [
    "Identify the relationship between the first pair, then find the same relationship in the answer choices",
    "Look for specific types of relationships: part-to-whole, cause-and-effect, synonym, antonym, etc.",
    "Eliminate options that have different relationship types"
  ],
  // ... more categories
};

export const READING_COMPREHENSION_TIPS = {
  inference: [
    "Look for clues in the text that point to the answer without stating it directly",
    "Eliminate answers that go beyond what the text supports",
    "Choose the answer that is most strongly supported by evidence"
  ],
  // ... more categories
};
```

#### Step 1.3: Update Solution Generation Logic
**File:** `/src/engines/questionGeneration/questionGeneration.ts`

**Modify `generateQuestion` function to:**
1. Include educational tip requirements in Claude prompts
2. Parse structured solution format
3. Validate solution completeness
4. Apply subject-specific tip selection

### Phase 2: Rule-Based Validation Pipeline (1-2 days)

#### Step 2.1: Create Validation Framework
**File:** `/src/engines/questionGeneration/enhancedValidation.ts` (new)

```typescript
interface EnhancedValidationResult {
  isValid: boolean;
  errors: string[];
  warnings: string[];
  validationSteps: ValidationStep[];
}

export async function validateQuestionEnhanced(
  question: GeneratedQuestion
): Promise<EnhancedValidationResult> {
  const validationSteps: ValidationStep[] = [];
  
  // 1. Mathematical validation (if applicable)
  if (isMathQuestion(question)) {
    validationSteps.push(await validateMathematically(question));
  }
  
  // 2. Answer option quality analysis
  validationSteps.push(validateAnswerOptions(question));
  
  // 3. Content similarity check
  validationSteps.push(await checkForDuplicates(question));
  
  // 4. Solution format validation
  validationSteps.push(validateSolutionFormat(question));
  
  // 5. Educational value assessment
  validationSteps.push(validateEducationalValue(question));
  
  return compileValidationResults(validationSteps);
}
```

#### Step 2.2: Implement Mathematical Verification
```typescript
function validateMathematically(question: GeneratedQuestion): ValidationStep {
  const errors: string[] = [];
  
  if (question.sub_skill.includes('Number Operations')) {
    // Verify arithmetic calculations
    errors.push(...verifyArithmetic(question));
  }
  
  if (question.sub_skill.includes('Algebraic')) {
    // Check algebraic consistency
    errors.push(...verifyAlgebra(question));
  }
  
  if (question.sub_skill.includes('Geometric')) {
    // Validate geometric relationships
    errors.push(...verifyGeometry(question));
  }
  
  return {
    stepName: 'Mathematical Validation',
    passed: errors.length === 0,
    errors,
    details: errors.join('; ') || 'Mathematical validation passed'
  };
}
```

#### Step 2.3: Content Similarity Detection
```typescript
async function checkForDuplicates(
  question: GeneratedQuestion,
  existingQuestions?: GeneratedQuestion[]
): Promise<ValidationStep> {
  
  if (!existingQuestions?.length) {
    return { stepName: 'Duplicate Check', passed: true, errors: [], details: 'No existing questions to compare' };
  }
  
  const similarities = existingQuestions.map(existing => ({
    question: existing,
    similarity: calculateTextSimilarity(question.question_text, existing.question_text)
  }));
  
  const highSimilarity = similarities.filter(s => s.similarity > 0.8);
  
  return {
    stepName: 'Duplicate Check',
    passed: highSimilarity.length === 0,
    errors: highSimilarity.map(s => `High similarity (${Math.round(s.similarity * 100)}%) with question: ${s.question.id}`),
    details: highSimilarity.length === 0 ? 'No duplicates detected' : `Found ${highSimilarity.length} potential duplicates`
  };
}
```

### Phase 3: Unified Section Generation Architecture (2-3 days)

#### Step 3.1: Create Unified Generator
**File:** `/src/engines/questionGeneration/unifiedSectionGeneration.ts` (new)

```typescript
interface UnifiedSectionRequest {
  testType: string;
  sectionName: string;
  targetDistribution: {
    practice_1: number;
    practice_2: number;
    practice_3: number;
    practice_4: number;
    practice_5: number;
    diagnostic: number;
    drill: number;
  };
}

export async function generateUnifiedSection(
  request: UnifiedSectionRequest
): Promise<UnifiedSectionResult> {
  
  // Calculate total questions needed
  const totalQuestions = Object.values(request.targetDistribution).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  
  console.log(`üöÄ Generating ${totalQuestions} unique questions for ${request.sectionName}`);
  
  // Initialize unified diversity tracking
  const unifiedContext: UnifiedGenerationContext = {
    usedTopics: new Set(),
    usedNames: new Set(),
    usedLocations: new Set(),
    usedScenarios: new Set(),
    generatedQuestions: [],
    questionsBySubSkill: {},
    sectionName: request.sectionName,
    testType: request.testType
  };
  
  // Generate all questions with unified context
  const allQuestions: GeneratedQuestion[] = [];
  
  for (const subSkill of getSectionSubSkills(request.testType, request.sectionName)) {
    const subSkillQuestions = await generateSubSkillQuestions(
      request.testType,
      request.sectionName,
      subSkill,
      calculateSubSkillDistribution(subSkill, request.targetDistribution),
      unifiedContext
    );
    
    allQuestions.push(...subSkillQuestions);
    
    // Update unified context after each sub-skill
    unifiedContext.generatedQuestions.push(...subSkillQuestions);
    updateUnifiedContext(unifiedContext, subSkillQuestions);
  }
  
  // Distribute questions across test modes
  return distributeQuestionsAcrossTestModes(allQuestions, request.targetDistribution);
}
```

#### Step 3.2: Enhanced Context Tracking
```typescript
interface UnifiedGenerationContext extends GenerationContext {
  sectionName: string;
  testType: string;
  crossModeTopics: Set<string>;
  crossModeScenarios: Set<string>;
  questionDistribution: Record<string, number>;
  diversityMetrics: {
    topicVariety: number;
    scenarioVariety: number;
    approachVariety: number;
  };
}

function updateUnifiedContext(
  context: UnifiedGenerationContext,
  newQuestions: GeneratedQuestion[]
): void {
  
  newQuestions.forEach(question => {
    // Extract and track topics
    const topics = extractTopicsFromQuestion(question);
    topics.forEach(topic => context.crossModeTopics.add(topic));
    
    // Track scenarios
    const scenario = extractScenarioFromQuestion(question);
    if (scenario) context.crossModeScenarios.add(scenario);
    
    // Update diversity metrics
    context.diversityMetrics = calculateDiversityMetrics(context);
  });
}
```

#### Step 3.3: Smart Question Distribution
```typescript
function distributeQuestionsAcrossTestModes(
  questions: GeneratedQuestion[],
  targetDistribution: Record<string, number>
): UnifiedSectionResult {
  
  const distribution: Record<string, GeneratedQuestion[]> = {};
  
  // Initialize empty arrays for each test mode
  Object.keys(targetDistribution).forEach(mode => {
    distribution[mode] = [];
  });
  
  // Distribute questions ensuring variety in each test mode
  let questionIndex = 0;
  
  for (const [testMode, count] of Object.entries(targetDistribution)) {
    const modeQuestions = questions.slice(questionIndex, questionIndex + count);
    
    // Ensure variety within each test mode
    distribution[testMode] = optimizeInternalVariety(modeQuestions);
    questionIndex += count;
  }
  
  return {
    sectionName: request.sectionName,
    questionsByTestMode: distribution,
    totalQuestionsGenerated: questions.length,
    diversityMetrics: calculateFinalDiversityScore(questions)
  };
}
```

### Phase 4: Database Reset & Systematic Regeneration (1-2 days)

#### Step 4.1: Create Cleanup Scripts
**File:** `/scripts/cleanup-questions-by-product.ts` (new)

```typescript
import { supabase } from '../src/integrations/supabase/client';

interface CleanupOptions {
  testType: string;
  sectionName?: string;
  testMode?: string;
  dryRun?: boolean;
}

export async function cleanupQuestions(options: CleanupOptions): Promise<CleanupResult> {
  console.log(`üßπ Cleaning up questions for ${options.testType}`);
  
  let query = supabase
    .from('questions')
    .select('id, question_text, test_mode, section_name')
    .eq('test_type', options.testType);
  
  if (options.sectionName) {
    query = query.eq('section_name', options.sectionName);
  }
  
  if (options.testMode) {
    query = query.eq('test_mode', options.testMode);
  }
  
  const { data: questionsToDelete, error: fetchError } = await query;
  
  if (fetchError) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch questions: ${fetchError.message}`);
  }
  
  console.log(`üìä Found ${questionsToDelete?.length || 0} questions to delete`);
  
  if (options.dryRun) {
    console.log('üîç DRY RUN - No questions will be deleted');
    return { deleted: 0, found: questionsToDelete?.length || 0 };
  }
  
  // Delete in batches to avoid timeout
  const batchSize = 100;
  let deletedCount = 0;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < (questionsToDelete?.length || 0); i += batchSize) {
    const batch = questionsToDelete!.slice(i, i + batchSize);
    const ids = batch.map(q => q.id);
    
    const { error: deleteError } = await supabase
      .from('questions')
      .delete()
      .in('id', ids);
    
    if (deleteError) {
      console.error(`‚ùå Error deleting batch: ${deleteError.message}`);
      continue;
    }
    
    deletedCount += batch.length;
    console.log(`‚úÖ Deleted batch ${Math.ceil((i + 1) / batchSize)} (${deletedCount} total)`);
  }
  
  return { deleted: deletedCount, found: questionsToDelete?.length || 0 };
}
```

#### Step 4.2: Create Section Regeneration Script
**File:** `/scripts/regenerate-section-unified.ts` (new)

```typescript
import { generateUnifiedSection } from '../src/engines/questionGeneration/unifiedSectionGeneration';
import { cleanupQuestions } from './cleanup-questions-by-product';

interface RegenerationRequest {
  testType: string;
  sectionName: string;
  cleanFirst: boolean;
}

export async function regenerateSection(request: RegenerationRequest): Promise<void> {
  console.log(`üöÄ Regenerating ${request.sectionName} for ${request.testType}`);
  
  // Step 1: Clean existing questions if requested
  if (request.cleanFirst) {
    await cleanupQuestions({
      testType: request.testType,
      sectionName: request.sectionName,
      dryRun: false
    });
  }
  
  // Step 2: Calculate target distribution
  const targetDistribution = calculateSectionDistribution(request.testType, request.sectionName);
  
  // Step 3: Generate unified section
  const result = await generateUnifiedSection({
    testType: request.testType,
    sectionName: request.sectionName,
    targetDistribution
  });
  
  console.log(`‚úÖ Regeneration complete:`);
  console.log(`   üìä Total questions generated: ${result.totalQuestionsGenerated}`);
  console.log(`   üéØ Diversity score: ${result.diversityMetrics.overallScore}`);
  console.log(`   üìã Distribution:`);
  
  Object.entries(result.questionsByTestMode).forEach(([mode, questions]) => {
    console.log(`     - ${mode}: ${questions.length} questions`);
  });
}
```

#### Step 4.3: Quality Assurance Scripts
**File:** `/scripts/validate-regenerated-questions.ts` (new)

```typescript
export async function validateRegeneratedQuestions(
  testType: string,
  sectionName: string
): Promise<ValidationReport> {
  
  console.log(`üîç Validating regenerated questions for ${sectionName}`);
  
  // Fetch all questions for the section
  const { data: questions } = await supabase
    .from('questions')
    .select('*')
    .eq('test_type', testType)
    .eq('section_name', sectionName);
  
  const report: ValidationReport = {
    totalQuestions: questions?.length || 0,
    duplicateCount: 0,
    ambiguousAnswers: 0,
    missingTips: 0,
    qualityScore: 0
  };
  
  // Check for duplicates across test modes
  const duplicates = findDuplicateQuestions(questions || []);
  report.duplicateCount = duplicates.length;
  
  // Check for multiple correct answers
  const ambiguous = findAmbiguousQuestions(questions || []);
  report.ambiguousAnswers = ambiguous.length;
  
  // Check explanation quality
  const missingTips = findQuestionsWithoutTips(questions || []);
  report.missingTips = missingTips.length;
  
  // Calculate overall quality score
  report.qualityScore = calculateQualityScore(report);
  
  console.log(`üìä Validation Report:`);
  console.log(`   Total Questions: ${report.totalQuestions}`);
  console.log(`   Duplicates Found: ${report.duplicateCount}`);
  console.log(`   Ambiguous Answers: ${report.ambiguousAnswers}`);
  console.log(`   Missing Tips: ${report.missingTips}`);
  console.log(`   Quality Score: ${report.qualityScore}/100`);
  
  return report;
}
```

## Database Strategy

### 1. Strategic Question Cleanup

**Approach:**
- Clean slate for products with known duplication issues
- Preserve all user data (progress, sessions, analytics)
- Only delete from `questions` and `passages` tables

**Priority Order:**
1. EduTest Scholarship (confirmed duplication issues)
2. Other products with suspected issues
3. Systematic review of all products

**Safety Measures:**
- Backup questions table before deletion
- Dry-run mode for testing cleanup scripts
- Batch processing to avoid database timeouts
- Detailed logging of all operations

### 2. Regeneration Strategy

**Section-by-Section Approach:**
```
Product: EduTest Scholarship
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Verbal Reasoning (183 questions total)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Clean existing questions
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Generate unified batch
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Validate results
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Mathematics (183 questions total)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Clean existing questions  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Generate unified batch
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Validate results
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Reading Comprehension (183 questions total)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Clean existing questions
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Generate unified batch
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Validate results
```

**Benefits:**
- Minimizes disruption (one section at a time)
- Allows quality validation before proceeding
- Enables rollback if issues arise
- Maintains service availability

### 3. Data Preservation

**User Data (PRESERVE):**
- `user_profiles` - All user information
- `user_progress` - Learning progress and statistics
- `user_test_sessions` - Test session history
- `test_section_states` - Section completion states
- `drill_sessions` - Drill attempt history
- `question_attempt_history` - Answer history

**Content Data (REGENERATE):**
- `questions` - Question content and metadata
- `passages` - Reading passages
- Question-specific foreign key relationships

**Migration Considerations:**
- User progress may reference deleted question IDs
- Need to handle gracefully in analytics queries
- Consider archiving old questions rather than deleting

## Testing & Quality Assurance

### 1. Automated Quality Checks

**Pre-Deployment Validation:**
```typescript
interface QualityMetrics {
  duplicateDetection: boolean;
  answerAmbiguityCheck: boolean;
  educationalValueScore: number;
  diversityScore: number;
  mathematicalAccuracy: boolean;
}

const QUALITY_THRESHOLDS = {
  maxDuplicates: 0,
  maxAmbiguousAnswers: 0,
  minEducationalValue: 80,
  minDiversityScore: 75,
  mathAccuracyRequired: 100
};
```

**Continuous Monitoring:**
- Daily quality scans on generated content
- Student performance analysis to identify problematic questions
- Feedback loop for continuous improvement

### 2. Student Performance Validation

**Metrics to Track:**
- Answer distribution across options (detect multiple correct answers)
- Time spent on questions (identify confusing questions)
- Skip rates (identify unclear questions)
- Performance improvement over time (measure educational value)

**Red Flags:**
- High success rate on "wrong" answers
- Extreme time variance on similar questions
- Consistent confusion patterns
- No improvement despite practice

### 3. Manual Review Process

**Expert Review Criteria:**
- Subject matter accuracy
- Age-appropriate difficulty
- Cultural sensitivity and Australian context
- Educational value and skill transfer
- Alignment with curriculum standards

**Review Triggers:**
- Low confidence scores from validation pipeline
- Unusual student performance patterns
- Feedback from educators or students
- Random sampling for quality assurance
