# ‚ö†Ô∏è Database Migration Required

## Issue Fixed
Drill writing progress preservation was not working because text answers weren't being saved.

## Code Changes Applied ‚úÖ
- Updated `DrillSessionService` to handle text answers
- Fixed `TestTaking.tsx` to save text answers for drill sessions
- Updated drill completion logic to include writing responses
- Fixed drill session resume functionality

## Database Migration Required üîß

**IMPORTANT**: The following SQL command needs to be run in the Supabase dashboard SQL editor:

```sql
-- Add text_answers_data column to drill_sessions table
ALTER TABLE public.drill_sessions 
ADD COLUMN text_answers_data jsonb DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb;

-- Add comment
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.drill_sessions.text_answers_data IS 'Stores written responses for extended_response questions in drill sessions. Format: {"question_index": "answer_text"}';
```

## Updated Database Functions üîÑ

The migration file also includes updated functions that will be applied automatically:
- `update_drill_session_progress()` - now accepts text_answers_data parameter
- `complete_drill_session()` - now accepts text_answers_data parameter  
- `get_drill_session_for_resume()` - now returns text_answers_data field

## After Migration ‚úÖ
Once the database migration is applied:
1. Writing drill responses will be saved and preserved
2. "Start Practice" will change to "Resume Practice"/"View Results" for writing drills
3. Writing assessments will work properly for drill mode
4. Progress tracking will show correct counts including writing questions

## Testing
After applying the migration, test by:
1. Starting a writing drill (e.g., "Persuasive Writing")
2. Write a response and exit
3. Return to the drill - should show "Resume Practice" 
4. Continue the drill - your writing response should be preserved
