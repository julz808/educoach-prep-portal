## IMPORTANT CODING STANDARDS AND PRINCIPLES

### Professional Development Practices
- **NO SHORTCUTS**: Always implement solutions properly and completely. No quick hacks or temporary fixes.
- **BEST PRACTICES**: Follow industry-standard coding practices, patterns, and conventions.
- **COMPLETE SOLUTIONS**: Implement features end-to-end with proper error handling, edge cases, and testing considerations.
- **CODE QUALITY**: Write clean, maintainable, well-documented code that other developers can understand.

### Honest Technical Partnership
- **CHALLENGE INCORRECT ASSUMPTIONS**: If something seems wrong or suboptimal, speak up immediately and explain why.
- **PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES**: Don't just point out problems - suggest better solutions with clear reasoning.
- **TECHNICAL HONESTY**: Be direct about technical limitations, potential issues, and better approaches.
- **QUESTION UNCLEAR REQUIREMENTS**: Ask for clarification rather than making assumptions.
- **PUSH BACK WHEN NECESSARY**: If a request could harm the codebase or create technical debt, explain why and propose alternatives.

### Implementation Philosophy
- **THINK BEFORE CODING**: Always plan the implementation thoroughly before writing code.
- **CONSIDER IMPLICATIONS**: Think about how changes affect other parts of the system.
- **MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY**: Follow existing patterns and conventions in the codebase.
- **DOCUMENT DECISIONS**: Explain why certain approaches were chosen, especially for non-obvious solutions.

## Project Overview

## Development Guidelines

### UI/Frontend Changes
- **Preserve existing look and feel** - only modify backend integration logic
- **No major UI redesigns** unless specifically requested
- **Focus on functionality**, not visual changes
- **Maintain current user experience** while enhancing backend connectivity

### Backend/Database Changes
- **Supabase schema should remain stable** - avoid table structure changes
- **Add database functions as needed** for new functionality
- **Update database-schema.sql only when necessary**
- **Focus on enhancing existing tables** rather than creating new ones

## Current Focus Issues

### Production Readiness Priority Issues
- Complete comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
- Implement unit and integration test suite
- Optimize performance and add monitoring
- Security audit and vulnerability assessment
- Browser compatibility and mobile responsiveness testing
- Accessibility compliance implementation

### Deployment & Integration Issues
- Vercel deployment configuration and environment setup
- Stripe integration for payment processing and paywalls
- End-to-end testing across all 6 products
- Cross-platform and cross-device validation
- Database backup and recovery procedures
- CI/CD pipeline implementation

### Deferred Issues (Lower Priority)
- Question generation hallucination in Mathematics/Quantitative questions (sufficient content exists)
- Validation pipeline for generated questions (can be improved later)
- Only VIC Selective Entry has extensive generated questions (other products have sufficient content)

## Testing Approach

- Use `npm run lint` and `npm run test:*` scripts for validation
- Manual testing via local dev server (`npm run dev`)
- Add unit and integration tests for all new features
- Test edge cases (network failures, concurrent access, data validation)

## Workflow Tips

- Keep this file up to date as the project evolves
- Use feature branches for new work
- Run lint and typecheck before committing
- Review all code changes before merging
- Document any non-obvious decisions or workarounds

## Useful Claude Commands

```bash
# Analyze current state
claude "Show me which components are using mock data instead of real database queries"

# Connect specific feature
claude "Connect the insights analytics to the user_sub_skill_performance table following the existing query patterns"

# Debug issues
claude "The performance analytics are loading slowly. Help optimize the database queries"

# Best practices
claude "Review the session management flow and suggest improvements following React/TypeScript best practices"

# Data analysis  
claude "Create performance insights queries that analyze user progress across all test modes"

# Question generation improvements
claude "Implement validation pipeline for question generation to catch mathematical errors and impossible questions"

# Multi-product question generation
claude "Run question generation scripts for all 6 products using existing curriculumData.ts configurations"

# Cross-product testing
claude "Test that all frontend/backend logic works consistently across all 6 products"
```

## Architecture Notes

- **Real-time persistence**: All user actions save to backend immediately
- **Backend-driven state**: No localStorage dependency, database is single source of truth
- **Multi-table coordination**: Updates across user_test_sessions, test_section_states, question_attempt_history
- **Cross-platform sync**: Session state synchronized across all devices and tabs
- **Offline resilience**: Answer queuing with automatic sync on reconnection

## Use Claude Code for:
- Production readiness tasks implementation (Phase 1 priority)
- End-to-end testing and validation (Phase 2)
- Vercel deployment setup and configuration (Phase 3)
- Stripe integration with Lovable (Phase 4)
- Performance optimization and monitoring (Phase 5)
