## 🚀 Impact on Question Generation

### Before This Work:
- **ACER:** Only 61% coverage → LLM would lack calibration for 39% of sub-skill/difficulty combinations
- **EduTest:** Only 93% coverage → Missing hardest (Level 3) examples for 5 sub-skills
- **Risk:** Inconsistent difficulty, poor question quality, unpredictable variations

### After This Work:
- **ALL products:** 100% coverage → Complete LLM calibration across all sub-skills and difficulties
- **Consistency:** Every difficulty level has proper examples for LLM to learn from
- **Quality:** Predictable, well-calibrated questions across all test types
- **Ready:** Can generate drills immediately for all 6 test products
