   - Integrated writing assessment processing on test completion
   - Automatic assessment triggered for all writing responses
   - Proper error handling and logging

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **Writing Submission**: User completes writing question in test interface
2. **Text Storage**: Response saved to `textAnswers` in session state
3. **Assessment Trigger**: On test completion, `processWritingAssessments()` identifies writing questions
4. **AI Processing**: Claude Sonnet 4 API called with rubric-based prompt
5. **Result Storage**: Assessment results stored in `writing_assessments` table
6. **Review Display**: In review mode, assessments loaded and displayed with detailed feedback

### Writing Question Detection
Questions identified as writing questions if:
- `format === 'Written Response'` OR
- `subSkill` contains "writing" or "written" OR
- `topic` contains "writing" or "written" OR
- No multiple choice options available

## Environment Requirements

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
VITE_CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key_here
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

### API Costs
- Uses Claude Sonnet 4 (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`)
- Estimated ~1000-2000 tokens per assessment
- Configured with low temperature (0.1) for consistent scoring

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Setup**
   - [ ] Verify migrations applied to database
   - [ ] Confirm Claude API key is configured
   - [ ] Check writing questions exist in database

2. **Writing Test Flow**
   - [ ] Start VIC Selective Entry diagnostic test
   - [ ] Navigate to Writing section
   - [ ] Complete a Creative or Persuasive writing task
   - [ ] Submit the test
   - [ ] Verify assessment processing in console logs

3. **Review Mode Testing**
   - [ ] Click "Review Answers" after test completion
   - [ ] Navigate to writing questions in review
   - [ ] Verify writing assessment feedback displays
   - [ ] Check criterion scores and overall feedback

4. **Error Handling**
   - [ ] Test with empty writing response
   - [ ] Test with API key disabled (fallback scoring)
   - [ ] Test with network issues (graceful degradation)

### Expected Database Records
After completing a writing test:
- New record in `writing_assessments` table
- Linked to correct `session_id` and `question_id`
