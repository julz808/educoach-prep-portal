## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Generate All Difficulty Level 1 Examples (20 examples needed)
Create easy-level examples for all 20 sub-skills following the difficulty progression descriptions already documented in the file.

### Priority 2: Fix Complex Multi-Step Problem Solving Sub-Skill
This sub-skill (#5.5 in Numeracy Calculator) needs correction:
- Remove one of the duplicate Difficulty 3 examples
- Add Difficulty 1 example
- Add Difficulty 2 example

### Example Generation Guidelines
The file already contains detailed `difficulty_progression` descriptions for each sub-skill that specify what Difficulty 1 should look like. Use these as the guide for creating missing examples.

### Consistency Check
After adding Difficulty 1 examples, verify:
- Each sub-skill has exactly 3 examples (one per difficulty level)
- Examples follow the documented difficulty progression
- Question formats match the specified patterns
- Distractors are appropriately calibrated for each difficulty level

## File Structure Notes

The file is well-structured with:
- Clear difficulty range definitions: [1, 2, 3]
- Detailed difficulty progression descriptions for each sub-skill
- Comprehensive pattern templates and key characteristics
- Appropriate distractor strategies documented

The foundation is solid; it just needs the Difficulty 1 examples to be complete.
