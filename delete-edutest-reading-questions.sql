-- After deletion, you can regenerate with:
-- npx tsx scripts/generate-all-remaining-edutest.ts

-- The new generation will ensure:
-- 1. Drill questions have 1:1 passage-to-question ratio (individual mini-passages)
-- 2. Practice/diagnostic tests have multiple questions per passage (5 passages, ~10 questions each)
-- 3. All passages use the new prose style cycling system for authentic variety
-- 4. No more repetitive "Imagine..." or "[Character full name]..." openings
