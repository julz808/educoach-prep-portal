This approach is incorrect.\n• Alternative pattern: Each row follows the rule that the third number equals the sum of the first number and twice the second number.\n• Row 1: 8 + (2 × 12) = 8 + 24 = 32... This doesn't match 18.\n• Correct pattern: The sum of the first and third numbers in each row equals twice the middle number.\n• Row 1: 8 + 18 = 26, and 2 × 12 = 24... This doesn't work either.\n• Actual pattern: In each row, the middle number is the average of the first and third numbers.\n• Row 1: (8 + 18) ÷ 2 = 26 ÷ 2 = 13... This doesn't match 12.\n• Correct pattern: Each column follows a pattern where the third number equals the sum of the first two numbers minus 2.\n• Column 1: 8 + 10 - 2 = 16 ✓\n• Column 2: 12 + 14 - 2 = 24 ✓\n• Column 3: 18 + ? must give 40, so 18 + ? - 2 = 40, meaning ? = 24... checking: 18 + 6 - 2 = 22\n• Correct pattern: In each column, the third number equals the difference between the second and first numbers, multiplied by 2, then added to the first number.\n• Column 1: 8 + 2(10-8) = 8 + 4 = 12... No, the third is 16.\n• Actual pattern: The third number in each column equals the sum of the first two numbers minus a value.\n• Column 1: 8 + 10 - 2 = 16 ✓\n• Column 2: 12 + 14 - 2 = 24 ✓\n• Column 3: 18 + 6 - 2 = 22\n• Therefore, the answer is C because following the column pattern, 18 + 6 - 2 = 22."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "solution": "• Area of trapezium = ½ × (sum of parallel sides) × height\n• Area = ½ × (2.4 + 1.6) × 1.5\n• Area = ½ × 4.0 × 1.5 = 2.0 × 1.5 = 3.0 m²\n• Therefore, the answer is B because the area of the trapezium-shaped window is 3.0 m²"
