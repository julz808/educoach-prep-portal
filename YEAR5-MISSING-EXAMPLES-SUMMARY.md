## 🎯 Next Step

Due to token constraints, I recommend one of these approaches:

**Option A (Recommended):** I create a separate file with all remaining 21 examples, which you can then manually merge into naplan-year5.ts

**Option B:** I continue adding examples one section at a time (will require multiple messages due to token limit)

**Option C:** We proceed to Year 7 NAPLAN conversion first, then come back to finish Year 5 examples

Which approach would you prefer?
